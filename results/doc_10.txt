Ok. Right away, looking at the screenshot of the article, I know it is a pretty reliable source because it is NPR, which does a lot of studies, and they do a lot of research, and I have looked at their studies in the past. I feel like that is a pretty good tell at the beginning because I know it is a reliable source because it has been used a lot. Ok, I also feel like they are a reliable source, because they have really reliable people being quoted in their article, like a spokesperson from the FDA. I know that they are going to be a reliable source. Next I'll probably look at the author. Ok, looking at the author's other stuff, seems like she is really reliable because she uses real stories for her other studies and other articles, and even when she is talking about a story of another person, it's mostly quotes from them, so it's not like she taking their words and rearranging them to make it seem like they are agreeing with everything she is saying. It's their quote, so it's their words, so she can't just change them how she wants. And then really fast, I just looked up articles that judged the reliability of NPR. One talked about how it is professional, and how it is used as a source for other websites, which gives it some credibility. First, the publisher is a very good indicator of how reliable the source is. NPR is used as a resource by other articles published. They are well-known and a professional company. Another thing that made the source reliable was the way they used hyperlinks to explain points in their article. If I didn't know a person or understand the topic, they allow me to access the information. It's not like they are trying to use language and studies I'm not familiar with so they can prove their point and make me agree with what they are saying without fully understanding. Expanded explanation on the topic could have been helpful. It also talked about how there was links in the article you could click on if you didn't understand a certain topic they were talking about, or you didn't know about this law that was passed that they're discussing, or you don't know the person they were referencing, so that you are able to access all the information. To me, that just seems like they are trying to get you as the reader to fully understand, instead of just pulling this thing over your head, like there is this and this and this and this, and you don't understand this, but you are going to agree, because you don't understand. They are like having the reader fully get into the article, which is very helpful. Well, looking at this article, I feel like when I read it, the author is talking about herself a lot, like she is talking about things she believes. I feel like she doesn't reference anything a lot, like she references the Harvard Business review once, but it's not like she is quoting them, she is just saying what they suggested, which isn't as reliable, because she can kind of change the aspect and meaning of what they are saying. Just looking at the screenshot, I'll probably give it a 5.  They also have I feel like the things on the side of the page tell a lot about an article. And the things on the side aren't very professional, unlike NPR. I mean, there is a picture of bacon on the side, and yeah it is talking about foods that trigger migraines, but I feel like It's not as professional as NPR was. And it's talking about packaged ice, that's not very relevant to the article, and it's not a very prestigious thing to have on the side of your article. But I feel like it has some credibility. Right at the beginning you can see that the author was the president of Savannah College of Art and Design. So that's got to say something. I'm going to look up the article to see if there are any comments or other things on it. And then at the end of the article, when you can see other articles that are like this, they show really unprofessional stuff, like 25 Makeup tips Older women should know. That doesn't make the site look professional.  I do like how you can easily go to the author of the article and see all of her achievements and what she has done in the past, that is really useful. More reliable: If you go to the Huffpost website you are able to see the author of this article and her achievements and her experience which makes the article seem a little more reliable to me because it makes the reader see that she has some grounds to write the article.¬ùSo here I wrote how the ability to see the author's experience and the achievements she has had that kind of correlate not really with what she is writing about, but with her as an author. Makes her seem like she has some grounds to stand on when she is writing the article. If I didn't read that thing, I would think Paula Wallace is just some random woman. Maybe she writes for the Huffpost, or maybe she works at McDonalds. Without being able to see her experience, I wouldn't really know anything about her or have a reason to trust what she is saying in the article. Seeing other recommended articles and sites at the bottom and on the sides of the article page really made it lose some reliability to me. When I went onto the Huffpost Page and looked at the article, other suggested articles were about popular make up trends for older women and why Hollywood won't cast certain actors anymore. This made the site seem kind of unprofessional. The article was taking on a legitimate topic and I would have thought that that made their company mature and professional until I saw the other recommended articles. Just by looking at the articles, like if you don't look anywhere else, it seems like a legitimate topic, you are talking about how universities can adapt. That is a very mature topic to take on, that makes it seem like Huffpost is very reliable and very mature and very professional. When you see all these suggested articles about Hollywood and makeup trends, and like 5 foods not to eat in the summer, that makes your site seem immature and not super reliable.  I do like how early in the article they talk about a specific study that's done that talks about what they are discussing in the article, that makes it seem more legit. And how it looks like, from the screenshot, there is a way to access the study so you can read more about it, I like that. And having specific quotes from someone with credibility, Professor Ronnie Glud of the Department of Biology at the SDU. And they're using other sources that are really popular and well-known, like NASA. And they even have a chart, good for them. I'm probably going to go with either 6 or 7.  Okay, I'll just look it up again. Okay, lets look at this Haskins person.  Seems like the author Justin Haskins talks about, overall, pretty professional topics. He talks about how some college students failed a citizenship test, but at least it is the U.S. citizenship exam, it's not talking about other dumb stuff college students do.  Ok, I like that one.  In the article the author uses specific quotes from people with credibility like Professor Ronnie Glud and explains why they are credible. Also uses very well-known organizations like NASA to support what they are saying. There is also a graph that represents the data he is talking about. And at the beginning of the article they make the study they are talking about accessible to the readers. The author also usually writes about mature and professional topics. Not really anything, it seems good, but I'm choosing to five it only an 8 because I know for a fact there are articles more reliable than this one out there.  I'm going to give this one an 8 to begin with. I feel like the publisher of an article is a very good indicator. Really famous ones like the Washington Post or NPR, I'm more willing to trust those websites than ones I haven't heard of like Huffpost. And again they use direct quotes and they say who they are quoting and why they are quotable.  That's not what I wanted. On the page of the Washington Post when you click on the author, you can see the little blurb about him. It's saying he covered the space and defense industries before Washington Post, so it seems like he has experience in this topic in the past.  By going to the author's page you can see that the author has experience in this topic and field in the past. Again, he is quoting reliable sources and saying why they are reliable. Also the Washington post is a well-known publisher which makes it seem more reliable as well.They use quotes from other well-known publishers like the Washington post. Able to access the survey that was taken.
