We wrote about it and everything. Okay. I don't want to continue reading because of the we wrote about it How do you So here it is, same thing. We wrote about it and everything 50% unintended pregnancy rate in the US What are the risks? Blood clots. Are you kidding? They're rare. I guess it seems reliable. Heard of all things considered. Different sources say the same thing. So it seems to be reliable.Less reliable: When they said we wrote about it and everything. They need to be more professional on a serious topic. A third way for universities. Pick sides and stay there. Vocational preparation I don't like the popups on the side, of bacon and snapchat. Usually that makes me think it's less reliable because they just want money rather than actually informing the public.I don't know what it's talking about. Career-specific education.Oh, I lived in Savannah. I think it's not to have school directed towards the job. There would be a lot more than one job  I guess it would be better to be educated in more than one thing.It seems pretty reliable. Talked about the Harvard Business Review. And the question that said, what qualities do employers need in their new hires, is good to think about. They don't necessarily want to be learning for the process of just getting a job, you could want to learn for more, about the reason to learn and get more knowledge, but everyone is different. Um 82% of college graduates researched their field of choice before determining what major to pursue in college. That's good. Prerequisite for the competitive workforce; certain fields yield higher incomes, but your major does not need to align with the industry. Your experience, be it on the job or off the job, is what people notice That's true. Soft skills, not major topic. Performer when you're aligned with your purpose. Your network matter. 60% of college graduates with bachelors degrees were working in a field that required a college degree. It's pretty reliable. I mean, it doesn't sound like they're just talking to talk. SCAD Huff Post. The actual topic seems reliable. It seems like a real topic people should pay attention. The actual topic seems reliable. It seems like a real topic people need to understand and focus on.I hate the ads. Global warming fail: study finds melting sea ice is actually helping Artic animals. Um, I don't think so. All the ads, too. The Blaze. That doesn't seem like a  I don't think it looks good.At least touting Was the more direct. Hunh.NASA's Grace satellites.I don't know, I just feel like less land, gives all animals less area to live. I mean, they're fine with the food they have, but I don't know.Polar bears give birth and hunt on sea ice and they need it to travel  Less sea ice, they may have to go without food. They can't just eat the algae, they eat actual animals. And if that disrupts, because then the polar bears would die, and it's the whole circle of life thing. Yeah, giving birth, they do it on land, and they can't give birth if there's no land, which is the ice. Um, it doesn't seem reliable, because I haven't seen anything like this before. All other sources basically disagree with itIt's called the blaze. The algae clings to the ice floes, so that one doesn't seem reliable at all. The chart or the graph makes it seem reliable. The graph makes it seem reliable because its from NASA.The ads make it less reliable and all other sources disagree.The ads make it less reliable. All other sources disagree. Elon Musk's SpaceX The Washington Post is reliable, and it does have ads, but it's not like other type of ads. It has a video, too, makes it more reliable. This seems pretty reliable, the ads on the side are just to other articles in the Washington Post, not like trying to sell you. The video gives a real thing. This seems pretty real. I would use this, if I was writing about, this kind of stuff. Wow. Yeah, it's a reliable source, I'm pretty sure. The video. The video and that is from The Washington post. I also saw different sources that said the same thing about it. It all seems fairly reliable. Growing crisis in care for disabled and elderly people. And it's a job crisis, too. How are Republicans standing in the way of adequate funding? So it's obviously written by a Democrat or a liberal. They made that pretty clear in their bashing of Republicans, which is very unprofessional. It kind of looks reliable. It just seems like they're just lying about it. Like they're just trying to make the Republicans look bad. I thought Medicaid was made by Obama.Lyndon B. Johnson So these people thought it was the federal government, but it's actually the state government, so it's not the Republicans fault. The problem with Obamacare is that doctors won't take it because they won't get paid. It's a terrible, it's not good. I don't think, it's not really reliable. The passion the writer writes with is strong and makes you want to believe it. They are just crushing the Republicans because Trump is president but the actual wages come from the states and not Federal Government.So they're just like blah blah blah.
