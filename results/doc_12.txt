Okay Gynecologist policy. Mm, NPR, I think that's pretty reliable.  Uh, same one. Uh, this is good sources. Give it a 9. Um, actually, hold on, look at more. Okay Yeah, so it's the same one. Okay.  Well NPR is always been kind of reliable, at least in my point of view, so. Uh, yeah, I've always enjoyed 'em, they're pretty unbiased. I just wasn't sure if it was the same one.  they always try to to make it unbiased with their sources. Actually, let me look at it again. Actually, mm They used, Mm I don't think, I don't like, I don't like the  about it and everything, that's a little, a little iffy. That, yeah that line we wrote about it and everything just doesn't work out. And besides that, there's no real, no real counterargument.  Let me check for Okay, um.  Yeah, just wish there was another  NPR. No. Yeah. It's too casual. I'll put you right there. NPR has always been, form my point of view, a very reliable source. Besides my previous knowledge of this organization, they used data from a relatively credible source, which was John Hopkins University of school and medicine.one things that made this source less credible from what I've seen, is the the line 'We wrote about it and everything.' That, to me, is too casual and a little out of place. Another thing is that there really isn't any counter argument to provide a reasoning as to why it's still in debate. Yeah, okay. Ooo.  Yeah, the beginning paragraph, just, just very biased. Yeah, the impressions is very biased.  I take with a grain of salt. Just Completely ignored the question. I'll raise it to a 6.  sound like they know what they're doing.  Huffington.  How to pronounce it.  Huff post. It's very passionate about what it believes.  And that can be both good and bad.  Appears to be very passionate about this issue. Just I don't like the beginning paragraph which is how biased it is. Okay What was the other word they used?  The members of generation z. It's teaching style, not sure. . . Yeah, it is teaching style. Unless it gives personal. Personal experiences that's .  And that example's a little old, I don't, I'd take it with a grain of salt as well. Style of teaching.  Successes with, success with . Have college, college part design.  Yeah,  part designs kinda different. Are very different from, other career, other studies that  word for it.  It's pressure resisting was for art and  and  and, and studies.  others, others such as engineering and law. Overall good article, just credibility's low.  Push it to a 6.  Make this one 6 as well.  Scrolls back down through article. Yeah, just the overall Huffington Post, I've always  Just from looking at it,  look at, just where their political,  not their political stance, but just like stance overall is,  is just very biased and is never,  is very, how should I put it, discriminating towards those who disagree.  So I, I trust what they say  with a grain of salt. The entire article is, or appears to be, very passionate about this issue. When someone is very passionate, they tend to fight for the issue at hand and put up a good argument. Also it at least gives a plan to integrate the teaching style into colleges. It also gives personal experiences of how the writer helped create a college and integrated the style of teaching into the college and it's success with it. The overall tone in this article is very condescending to anyone who doesn't agree with their point. You can see it at the very beginning when it uses words such as millennials or members of generation Z vs. cultural icons and thinkers, for the latter they used examples of respected/famous icons. Also the example used was from almost 40 years ago and its premise for existing was for art and design and those studies very different from others such as engineering and law.The Blaze?  Uh, that's don't, uh, too much research.  'Kay , one, two, three , global warming , sea ice is actually helping.  Mm, isn't this a  I think this is actually.  yeah, yeah  somethin'  not  but, just like a tabloid. The ads are a little. thriving as because , grammar issue, but it's arctic research are thriving as because, yeah that , studies' new findings  conditions have produced a large number of life-sustaining .

There's, there's no  lost too many square kilometers of artic ice I mean, that's kinda bad. Overall, I'd give it a low seven.  Just.  I don't know. Blaze,  wait, is it the Blaze or? It's the Blaze. Oh yeah, this, the Blaze, yeah.  Yeah, it's poop. Yeah, the science , I don't agree with it, but, I don't know, I don't know much about it. Does the science help this.  May be good. Overall though, there wasn't much that I was pretty  pleased with. As to why this may be good.  those ads were a little disheartening. Is there really an ?  Was he a professor?  Profe- yeah. . Um, professor of the department of biology.  Whoops. could be seen as  yeah that entire science thing was a little it was seen as questionable. Is there anything else that I didn't really like? The ending.  Yeah just  Is there anything else that I need to look at. . Is there anything else I need to look at.  Um no.Text written in the first text box: The use of science from a from a professor from the Department of Biology helped this argument by providing a foundation as to why this may be good.Text written in the second text box: For one the ads on the side were a little disheartening while the overall science that this argument was based on could be seen as questionable. Also as I researched into the site itself, the topics that it chose to report on where very questionable. The ending didn't really give me a sense that this was in fact beneficial but more just bad for the environment.The Washington Post? Yeah.  Okay. Mm. M'kay, uh, this is talking about the  this is talking about overall Those ads are definitely better than last time.  pretty basic ads, so nothing to be too mad about. Um,  . Yeah, so it's taken from the source, that's good. Yeah I think  I'll give this an 8, , I like it. Washington post.  Yeah, I think yeah, I definitely think  I'd give it  a little higher  viewing. Should probably give it a 10 just from this article's reliability?  I'll say it's pretty reliable.  Yeah, so I think it's pretty reliable.  Okay, maybe a 9. Yeah, I'd still give it a Yeah I'd give it a 9 because I'm not sure who  Yeah, I just is it Elon Musk?  I think it's Elon Musk, let me see.  Yeah, it's Elon Musk.  Yeah  Mm.  But yeah Overall just took it from the source and then there's really not much I don't like about it. It's just, kinda, it's more of a description.  I also, just I just  maybe  come, more comes off, that's not It's more just giving info, but  appears . to the reader. Um  . It's just, it's the lack of of a problem.  It's almost, it's almost like they perceived, it's almost perceived  as a perfect plan. Uh, I don't know  I don't know, though there's really not much I hate about it. .  source is good,  I wouldn't trust it with everything, I would trust it with everything such as politics . but, the subject doesn't have anything to do with politics, so yeah . I was thinking the only thing I don't like is just the fact that there's no counterargument just a problem that makes this  not a perfect plan.  That's the only thing I don't like about it. It's kind of, it's almost like it's a perfect plan, which it isn't.Text written in the first text box: It takes a lot of info from the source, in this case Elon Musk and what he had to say about the project. It also comes off that it isn't promoting this event to super heights, more that it's just giving info to the reader. Text written in the first second box: The only real thing that I didn't like is the lack of a problem with the plan, it's almost perceived as a perfect plaan. Daily costs growing crisis in care for disabled and other Oh, it's a job crisis. The, it catches the reader, but I don't like it.  The ads are a little, yeah, the ads again  are a little, oh, is this a blog?  Uh, daily kos.  Yeah,  Yeah, it looks to be the actual thing looks to be unbiased. I would take it with a grain of salt though , the ads, the title's a little  iffy, but then it's a blog too, I think. Or it looks, it looks like it. I don't think it is now looking at it.  nursing system  ruin job  ten bucks an hour for a job that often involves lifting other people to into and out of bed . Okay, in positions.  know what would be a good thing for jobs if people go to school. bad for the elderly, but it'd only be for a few years. I like it though, the I might give it a 7.  Just because  the actual contents actually really, it's good, it's kinda, it gives good stats, it gives kind of people in the business, it gives their voice. It's a good one, I like it. Well, let me rephrase that , I think it's good for what it does.  As for the source, uh, not , a little,  I'm always  doesn't really improve.  Just kinda stays the same for me. Always misspell business.  I guess the point of view of those actually in the business .  you can't really have counterargument. It gives like a solution, but other than that, I mean, I think that's the best you can do. not much  going against it, I just don't like the ads on the side. Like, I really don't like the ads on the side.  The title's, the title is [sound of disgust].  Title's not that good.  The credibility  of the source doesn't really impact me that much, I think,  can be, can go either way. But just looking, looking at like what they have on the top, like because democrats  looks  to be kind of, not unbiased, but gets something for everyone,  so I'm, I'm, I don't know. So I don't think  I'd trust it like as much as, like, say, NPR or Washington Post, but I would trust it in the sense that I would get at least something from it. . Let me read stats again  Serious low. . They have, the overall writing's really good, and I think that's good. this problem  Mm.  No, that's, yeah. For that make it less. I would say it's the ads and title. I don't tr-  just from reading I guess  I'd make it eight. I guess read it, yeah.  I wouldn't give it a nine or ten  just isn't my  little question. The ads on the side better question. I should probably  my question.  Topics they introduce, not topic.  The title too, catching, catching the reader, is also questionable because it comes as  Yeah, I would say  comes from a tabloid. Is that really it though?  Yes, I'd argue it is.
