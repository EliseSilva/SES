The time that this article was posted is 3:09 PM, which is not a crazy time. If it was posted at 3:09 AM it would be a little sketchy. The phrasing we wrote about it and everything is really unprofessional, it makes me think it is not a very good article. I'm trying to look at the name and website and stuff, to see if it looks legit or not, and I can't tell. The title is phrased so weird, it should be researches say over the counter drugs blah blah blahbut it's saying the opposite, as if someone not so intelligent wrote it. Reliability probably 3 or 4.  I might change that. I found a book called Reform of over-the-counter derivatives markets which, by reading out loud, I realized it has nothing to do with anything, so actually, nevermind. I'm not really finding anything on this over the counter birth control. The fact that the article looks professional for the most part would make me think that it is a reliable source. The wording used in the article and the title makes this article seem less reliable. Okay, off the bat, I recognize Huffpost is a super popular newsfeed page, but I actually can't remember if it's because it is real, or because it is fake. Okay, Huffpost, I'm pretty sure I've used it before, maybe not in a research paper, but when I read things off of Huffpost then I think that they are pretty reliable. The way things are worded are intelligently written and have good grammar and stuff. And, other than the ads on the sides, it looks professional.  The things that it is stating in this article seem to be backed up by other things that have been written, which makes it fairly reliable. Huffpost is a popular website that I have used before for information and I trust it. The ads on the side make it seem a little bit less reliable.Okay, this article looks like articles you would find on facebook that are clickbait and don't actually mean anything. But it has a graph, which I know is super easy to fake, but, I don't know. Graphs always make me want to believe it. I don't know, I'm going to read it. Okay, the only thing that they have quotes from is press release, and I think that is super vague. Which makes me think that this article is not reliable. The graph at the end made me want to believe the article was true. 'Press release' was the only thing they were quoting from which is a little suspicious. The only thing I am finding on the other tab is global warming affects animals, it's not saying good or bad, except for one that said it was bad. So that's not very helpful.  right off the bat, makes me feel like it is very reliable, because Washington is the capitol and they can't lie to us, right?  It just looks really professional. There are still ads on the sides, but this looks like the kind of article I would do a research paper on. They have quotes from good people and it's very nicely written. Maybe ads just mean that it's visited so often because it's telling the truth, they want to make money off of it.  I'm finding some stuff on SpaceX, don't know if it is the same as what this is saying (referring to the screenshot), but you know what, this looks very reliable. The way the page is maintained and the quotes they used are all very professional, also Washington post is a page I'd visit for correct information.The ads are slightly misleading but I got over it and still think it's reliable. The only reason why this isn't 10, is because the Washington post isn't a full-on paper from someone doing research and writing about it, it's more like a couple steps down, but that's the only thing holding it back. This whole page looks like a clickbait site, and the title looks like someone just spoke it into a microphone and it typed it for them, it looks so bad. It looks so bad I don't even want to read it. Like this one quote I read, it's about a catheter, like I don't care. I don't know, this doesn't look very good to me.  I don't even know what to search for, the title gives me no idea what this is talking about. The fact that is has a few quotes to back it up. The page looks fake, the title is awful and makes me not want to read the article. If I saw this I would not trust anything it said because it looks like it's all about someone's opinion not actual research.
