First of all, the topic of the article is a little sketchy. It is like something you would usually see at the bottom of a CNN page. But I don't know, always give everything a chance. It's pretty recent. Public Health I've never heard of NPR sounds familiar. Johns Hopkins University is pretty reliable.  The fact that it has a little add on the side is a little questionable, but that is not a ruiner. That's pretty good that it came up first. But that might just be, I don't know. NPR looks like they know what they are talking about. Looks like they have a radio station and supporters and it looks like they have a wide variety of articles That looks interesting It doesn't look like it has any party affiliation at first glance, but I haven't looked that deep.  Just reading through the articles right now to see. It seems pretty unaffiliated politically, so that seems good. Seems pretty neutral when talking about political stuff so that is a good sign. I haven't had anything to compare it to yet, so I don't know. I am probably going to give it a 9. It didn't really blow me out of the water with its reliability but that's a good one. respectable source. No evident political affiliation from NPR. The appearance of the article, as well as the ads on the side give it a nonlegitimate feel. I have never heard of the Savannah College of Art and Design but I am guessing it is real. Huffington post. That is not the most reliable, but for the most part I think it is reliable. I am going to read the first part of the article now.  So she created the Savannah College of Art and Design. Oh, it says it right there, wow. So far into the article it looks reliable. It is pretty recent to so that is a good thing about the same time period. I am going to go check out the source. So it is Huffington Post. This page seems a little bit liberal just by the way that Bad News from the Trump Trip, Conservative accuses”that is negatively conotated words right there: Trump rage tweets, Trump might try to threaten. And of course Trump is not liberal so that is what is giving me that vibe. Not that that makes much of a difference but it is good to keep in mind that your source is coming from a liberal point of view. Might be a little bit biased. It is just attacking Donald Trump. Which doesn't necessarily mean Liberal these days, they just might not like Trump. Because of its affiliation, I am going to put I am torn between 6 and 7 because this is a pretty popular source. But popularity doesn't always mean reliability.  But I mean, as long as you do your research and you know exactly what the bias is then you are good, and you know which way the article is going to lean.  recent date, credible author. Actually I am going to check out that Savannah College really quick. At first glance, not too many students, but the fact that they're there means it's a school. I am just making sure it is a legitimate school. Looks like it is in Georgia too so it is a US college although it says here that they have classes in Hong Kong also, which is interesting. So that's a legit college. Recent date, credible author Less Reliable:The host website, huffington post, might have a slight political slant which means that some articles may be biased. These are the adds I was talking about, the first article, it looks like one of these articles that you just click on on the side about birth control and whatnot. Okay, the fact that it has these adds is a little bit of a throw off, but I mean, that doesn't curve the fact of the reliability at all, doesn't knock it down any. So this one is recent too, about the same time as the other two. I haven't heard of the Blaze, I am going to say it sounds familiar but, I can't actually think of what it is right now. Interesting title. I am going to read through the first little part of it. This chart in here, that is a good thing, it has data, it looks like it is quoting NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center, I haven't heard of that but it sounds legit and if they put it side by side with NASA it has got to be pretty important. SDU, South Dakota maybe, Department of Biology Professor, they are quoting all really good source, which I am going to say is really good and helps out their reliability. I kind of want to check out the author and the Blaze so I am going to do that really quick. Unfiltered voices so that is good. Based in Texas, that shows some worries about their political affiliation because usually Texas is pretty strong with theirs, but I haven't notices anything about that yet, except for the fact that the article was disclaiming global warming. Which I mean I am pretty sure that is a pretty prevalent liberal view, or Democratic view. But it looks like they are pretty stretched out, television, radio, and internet, ummm Glen Beck sounds familiar. Just scanning through, I notice the word Republican, that doesn't seem to be anything too important though. They just wanted to host the republican presidential debate, which gives me the feeling that they are more republican; but once again, can't let that affect reliability. Just maybe a little bit of bias, but I haven't really seen any bias. Maybe if I go to The Blaze and take a look at a few article titles.  It doesn't really look that official. It looks like something that a high school or college student could have programmed or made. But that isn't going to deter. There it is, a little bit of Republicanism.I think FOX is republican too. Yeah, this is really republican, wow, I didn't really see the bias at first. It doesn't look as slanted though as the last one, because the last one was in your face, like everything was against Trump, this one, there is a little thing, making liberals' heads implode I am reading this and it doesn't seem to be too liberal or republican or conservative I mean. This one is tricky. I am not going to lie here, this one right here  just seems a little bit, oh it's sponsored, okay. That was a little questionable. So it has something, like this is definitely something a Republican would click on, but I mean, I am not seeing a whole lot of here it is against left-wing rioters, that is kind of shinning a bad light on them. Liberal protester arrested. Yeah, so I am going to give this one a 7 like the last Because it is pretty much, the source looks pretty much the same, except this one was conservative and the last one was liberal Quoting reliable sourcesObvious political affiliation. The Washington Post, that is a popular name March 30th, I am guessing 2017, but I might have to look that up. That is an interesting article Once again, the ads on the side, these ones are not too sketchy at first glance The Washington Post, this article does not seem to have any political or other bias I am not seeing too many quotes or statistics. There is quote right there Space X is present, which is what this article is talking about. I am just going to look up the Washington Post really quick. This says it is liberal Democracy Dies in DarknessThis one has a complete different outlook on the G-20, looks like he is delighted to meet Trump so maybe this one is a little more republican or conservative. This one looks a little bit more, usually the mention of Middle Eastern News or Immigrants and such is more liberal. So what do they have to say about Hilary Clinton. Looks like they are in support of her President Trump bizarreI am going to say this one is an 8 Because it has slight bias, but it looks a lot more reliable. I know teachers have used the Washington Post before. You have to trust your teachers. They obviously have a lot more education than us. Very little bias, Washington post is popular, teachers have used it before. Slight political bias. So, that is recent againOkay, at first glance she looks a little republican, just from what this saysThat is a good fact right there, and another one, and another oneThat is a little informal right there, look at that, it says WTF. But that could just be an add though. No, it is recommended, so that could be from this site.  Repealing Obamacare could violate international lawAnd then this one is supporting Hilary Clinton. So, I am going to say it is a little liberalDaily KOS I have never heard of. 35:30Daily kos. ˜Headache over Trumpcare'. This website gives me a good vibe, just looking at it, it looks like a well-established website.Hashtag Republicans, let's see that,  looks like a definition.  I guess this is just a whole bunch of stuff that I looked at with the last one, er, this screen shot. So I am going to go back down to sev. I am going to say seven on this one, because I didn't recognize the source. Article seems unbiased, statistics and facts included.slanted political articles on the side.
