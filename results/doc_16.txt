So at first glance this article seems relatively reliable; the writing is somewhat amateur, but it does use some decent sources. There are some grammatical errors in this article. The article used direct quotes from professionals. It also used a few statistics, and since the website ended with .org, it seemed more reliable than one ending with .com would. One thing to note, the article did use some statistics, which made it seem more reliable, like they knew what they were talking about. But at the same time it did have all those grammatical errors. The article did include some grammatical errors. The writing didn't sound very scientific, and it was somewhat basic, making me question the ethos of the author behind this article. This article was written by a president and founder of a university, so, so far it seems authentic.  It's focusing on a timely issue.  The writing is interesting, he does seem like he cares about what he's talking about.  It is a very recent source. The only thing is, I think the writer might be a little biased, as he is the president of a university who is automatically going to support this third way. It was written by the president and founder of a university. He took the time to put passion into his writing, to make it more interesting, and I think that in itself gives him more credibility on the topic. However, this article did seem very opinion-based, especially when you consider the university he's coming from, and there were no quotes or sources used in the article. I would also question the website on which this article was written. It was a good source, but not necessarily a good scientific or professional source.The only thing that really bothered me was that he didn't quote too many things, there weren't really many sources or statistics from what I read, but that's pretty much the only thing I would question about it; maybe not use this in a research paper. Immediately I'm noticing a lot of ads on this website, don't know if I like the look of that. It does mention a study in the title.  So it said that researches at the University of Southern Denmark did this. Personally, I don't know anything about that university, but that does make that seem like a better source, even if it never specifically mentions the researches by name. And it does have some errors in the article, grammatically.  I love how it does have a graph, and it does have data to back it up, that's definitely something you could use if you are looking for a good source.  The only thing that really bothers me is the website that this is on, it doesn't really look like any kind of scientific journal or something like that.  The title indicates that it is written more to be a sensational article than something professional to cite. The use of a graph and data really strengthened this source. There was a direct quote from a professor at the university. The website that this article appeared on seemed questionable. It was infiltrated with ads. The title indicated that this was more of a sensational article trying to capture any ordinary reader's attention. The writing is not quite as professional as you'd expect from a reliable source.And in psychology we talk about the importance of differentiating between correlation and causation. And the article is making it sound like the melting sea ice is actually causing the arctic sea animals to be helped, so the wording with the title is a little off, I think. we have a This one does not have quite as many ads as that last article.  So this writer does seem to know what they are talking about. They use direct quotes from the source of what they are writing about, and they used plenty of examples. I don't know if I would classify them as an expert on the subject. And it's from the Washington Post, which is pretty well-known. March 30, so it is a very current source.  And the author does have experience in covering space industries for the post, so we know that the author has some credibility in the subject. Though I still don't know if I would necessarily call him an expert on it. The author had some experience writing in topics like this. Many quotes were used from significant people involved with the project and with NASA in general. The article appeared in the Washington Post, which is a very well-known news source. Though the author had some experience in matters like this, it never struck me that he was an expert in the subject. One thing that I have wished for from all these author is more personal experience in the subject. None of these authors have really struck me as having first-hand experience and being that reliable source of what they are talking about. It does give you the results of a survey. I can see how this article is both good and bad. It does use a lot of quotes and a lot of numbers that definitely make it more credible. And the author creates some pathos there with some of the quotes they give that are kind of vivid. But at the same time the writing does seem rather casual and somewhat opinion-based. And I would question the website, don't know much about it. I'd probably give it a 5, I don't know if I would trust this article in particular, but definitely some of the sources that it uses I would trust. I like how it used the specific examples of people who have actually gone through this. And as soon as I get to the page, all these ads start popping up. And the article really doesn't seem that well-developed, when you look at it. And I'm also not really seeing anything about the author, so I don't know how credible the author is on this subject. The author used direct quotes that created emotion. Figures and numbers were given to us that made it seem like she knew what she was talking about. I did not like the explosion of ads that appeared on this page when I first opened it up. There wasn't any kind of author biography so there's no evidence of how credible she was on the subject. The article was opinion-based and not developed all that well, so overall I would not trust it as a source.And that's I really had to say about that particular article.
