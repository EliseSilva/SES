Okay so I'm thinking that this article does have some reliability. I really like the fact that there's a name at the end of the article of the assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I like the fact that they specifically referenced who was saying the quote. But something that I'm not too sure about is that it keeps on saying researchers say and it's not specific about that, such as in the 5th paragraph where it says But researchers say there is no evidence that adolescents are at greater risk so I don't think that's too reliable because it's not being specific enough. But overall I think that it can be a credible source, because I think there's links here, probably to other research; like the second to last paragraph talks about a review of oral contraceptive research, so that might have a link to something specific. So overall I would probably give it a 5.  I like how they quote a specific professor from Johns Hopkins University. I also like how it makes a reference to the Journal of Adolescent Health. They use a vague term when they say researchers. They don't specify who or what group of researches. I want to know if it's something like the Pew Research Center, etc. I also find it really interesting that it references the Journal of Adolescent Health which is something that I am going to look up right now.  So yeah, that looks pretty reliable. I like the fact that it's mentioned in this article. So I will probably increase the reliability of this. . Just looking at it, the fact that it included the term researchers I gave it a 5 but I think now that I've been able to look online and find that the journal is something that is pretty reliable I'll give it a 7. Huff Post Article This article looks like an opinion editorial, so it might have a lot of opinions instead of facts, but I haven't read it yet, just by looking at the picturesI've heard of the Huffington Post though, so I know it's a real news company. Okay, so without even using the browser yet to find the credibility I like the fact that the writer herr I feel like they know what they're talking about because they've included thoughts from cultural icons like Steve Jobs and CNN's Fareed Zakaria, and the author, which is Paula Wallace, is a president and founder of Savannah College of Art and Design so she probably knows what she is talking about when it comes to talking about universities. And I like the experience that she shares when she helped create Savannah Art College in 1978. And just scanning the article again, they include information from the Harvard Business Review, which I think is pretty credible coming from Harvard or any university for that matter. But I will look to make sure that these people are who they say they are.  Yup, so you can see here on Google that there's a Wikipedia page that pops up; Paula Wallace is indeed president of Savannah College of Art and Design. There's also a link to SCAD.edu that talks about Paula Wallace's biography. So I would feel that this article is pretty reliable because it's coming from someone that's the president. Now if they're correct I have no idea because I have no experience in university administration but I would respect her opinion a lot because she's a president. So I would give this article an 8. I like it. I like that fact that Paula Wallace is a president of a university and she is talking about her area of expertise. I also like the reference to the Harvard Business Review in the last paragraph. I feel that anything Harvard-related is most likely very credible. Okay so I just remembered that I watched something on TV wherr it was like the President's Ball or something, where all the news reporters gathered together and there was a guy making fun of like CNN, and Fox News, and just everybody, and I do remember that they made fun of the Huffington Post, so I'm not quite sure like how well respected they are for news. Because I also know that a lot of these news places have biases, so, that's something that I just realized I would have to really consider when taking news from like CNN and Fox News, that they usually come with a bias, either like a left bias, or like a party bias, so I don't know if that makes this article less reliable to me, but that is something that's in the back of my mind, that I do remember hearing about the Huffington Post. Granted they were making fun of everybody, but I've also heard of people making fun of Huffington Post outside of that singular event. So that's the only thing that would make it less reliable to me, is the bias of Huffington Post, because I've heard just a little bit about them, so that would probably make it less reliable to me. It's not like the last article, where it was talking about health stuff, this is different, slightly.  Most likely that it comes from the Huffington Post.  I googled that they lean towards a liberal mindset so I would have that in mind when reading this article. Even though it is about education and not politics. Alright, so, I'm just looking at it, I haven't read anything yet, but I just know already because I remember someone got fired from The Blaze that this article leans conservative. I just know that in the back of my mind, I came back from my mission six months ago so I don't know too much about politics but I have heard about them. They were on the news, on CNN. So I do know they will be saying that global warming is a myth. So that's pretty much all I know about The Blaze, that they are conservative, super conservative. So I'm already reading this with the mindset that I'm going to read something that is conservative. And there's these really funny articles on the side and I don't know if they are taking this article too seriously because it's like:  Why do the Amish keep these practices a secret? There's a good reason. So it just looks like they may be making this to grab public attention. They also have sports on the side, and they also have clothing on the side. So I'm not sure how serious they are about this. They have a chart. I like that.  Interesting. Alright, so, just looking at it, I probably would give it a credibility score of 4. And, after checking the sources, I would probably still give it a 4, and my reason being is that there's only one research study that shows that this might be possible. I haven't seen any other ones that say something about how global warming is helping artic. Yup pretty much just The Blaze is saying this. Everyone else is saying This is not helping. So yea, don't know how credible that can be. It is a university, but it's only one, so I don't know how much to trust it. The article includes research from a university.  There is only this university and The Blaze that are saying that global warming is helpful. Too many people are arguing with this group. Washington Post I think it's pretty reliable, just by looking at it. Rates it a 7. Because it's talking about an event, that occurred. It doesn't look like there's too much bias in this, either from a political party or from the writer. . OOOh He's an associate professor of government and politics and senior fellow and director of research for the Center for International Development and Conflict. Yeah, this guy, this guy knows what he's talking about. I researched Christian Davenport, and since I don't see too much bias in this article, I feel his source is pretty good, I'm going to give it an 8. Christian Davenport is an associate professor. I respect that. Hmm what makes it less reliable?  I didn't find anything. I'm not going to give it a perfect score because I don't like giving perfect scores that much. I really can't find anything to make it less reliable for me. I like the style of writing, they did a pretty good job, easy to follow. Nothing really makes this source less reliable for me. I couldn't find any sort of political bias like the last article from the Blaze. Yeah, so I don't really know. I googled the Washington Post is conservative or liberal, but I don't really see any bias there so, next. Daily KosThey talk about timely issues; this issue is probably a timely one. It was printed by Laura Clawson on Monday April 24, 2017. It includes surveys. It has a quote from someone that is disabled or elderly, yup, some experience. Aha, I found a slightly political bias! It says but to republicans making America great again does not involve protecting Vedder's health or making sure that the people who provide her care are paid a living wage. Okay, so there's some bias here. But I would give the credibility score a solid 6, even though there's bias there. It has information from a survey which I always like because it's factual. And then it has someone's opinion. A person. It isn't always factual but it's an experience of someone that's speaking out. And now I will just google real quickly if the Daily Kos is liberal as I think it is.  So Wikipedia says that the Daily Kos is a group blog and internet forum focused on liberal American politics. Interesting. So it's liberal American politics.  Cool so I found a website it's called Media Bias/Fact Check, and it says that the Daily Kos is indeed liberal. I like that they include factual evidence such as a survey done in Wisconsin.  I also like how they quote from a leader from Leading Age Wisconsin.  I also like the fact that they pull from a leader from a nonprofit organization. I typically think that nonprofits are not biased but I don't know how right that is but that's what crosses my mind when I read nonprofit, that they aren't biased either way, so I like that.  I googled the Daily Kos to find out their political affiliation and its liberal. I also didn't like how they were putting down the republican party in the article. It's just me but I don't like when either party puts down either party for something. Just personal taste whenever I read something, I don't like reading Democrats are or Republicans are. Just my personal taste.
