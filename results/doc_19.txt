It doesn't really say any facts. So you pretty much don't know much of what is going on. You only know that California and Oregon have birth control and it's okay. It doesn't really say if it's safe or not. So pretty much it just says that people under 18 are still required to get their first contraceptive prescription from a doctor. So they're probably saying it is okay to have birth control when you are younger. You just have to have your doctor say it's okay. I'll go to WebMD. Some people use it for when they don't want to get pregnant, but then some people use it because it clears your acne. But overall, I don't think this source, Public Health Shots from the NPR website, is really telling your much, especially in this screen shot, about how it is really that safe. It just talks about the age and how there are two places that have laws set. The source was dated to 2017 so that means that most of there research may be up to date and shows that they did some recent research. Doesn't give me the full understanding that birth control is safe for teens. It's a pretty long article.I put a 5, because it has some good points, but they only talked about a specific school. If they talked about other schools and mentioned them as well and talked about how they can combine education and education for careers and how that connects, I'd put it higher. But because there is only one set school I didn't. When I looked up a different source I could see different schools that have implemented the need for people to think about there career. There isn't only one way to look at school and the way they teach the way to a career so showing different ways they could add that in would have been better. So global warming is kind of. So it's good that it is melting so that they can go places and get food. It had points specifically set to show why it was a good thing that global warming happened in the arctic. Oh, that's how you spell artic. I didn't know that. Didn't really show the pros and cons of global warming just went out and said the main parts.Another one! Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It's so quiet in here. So it's a rocket. Oh yeah.  That's cool.That's cool. I like it. What's the other one called? Elon Musk. Oh, it shows the video of Falcon 9 and its launch. Sweet. So they keep doing it. I don't want an ad. So they keep doing it until they can figure out something, something that is wrong with it. So they keep launching and good things happen. Oh California. That's where I am from.That one was good. I liked it. I liked it. I was able to watch a video in the article that showed what was happening during the flight and if they landed it.It was of one flight that they did not all of them. Another one! That's a touchy subject.They make $10 an hour for taking care of old people! That's not much. I wouldn't want to do that job if I was only making $10 an hour. Yep, you need to pay more if you want people to do it. Yep, there are a lot of old people. What's sad is that there is no one proud of their family who will help out more, so other people have to do it. Which is sweet. Yeah, if no one is there how they going to be clean, how are they going to eat, how are they going to get their pills? Obviously they need people there and they can't just not show up or just be like JK, not coming.Oh Trump. Whatcha gonna do? So, let's look for a. I read an article in my government class in high school and it talked about elderly people getting abused by people like this, which is scary. But I don't know, that is in different places so it's hard. I don't know if it is really a job crisis; I've never heard of it. I guess, I've only heard about the negative things, like how they are abused in their sleep or when they are taking a shower, when people help them. There might be a job crisis because of those people, so now people are paying attention, but they aren't saying about that. They're probably just trying to stay focused too, like money and how people are not coming and showing up; they're just flaking on them.See! Risk to the patients. Cause some people are just doing it because they have to, but don't do a good job. Yep, there are some people who have been doing it for a long time, who are tired of it and just want to get out. That is true. True fact.I'll give them the same thing. It talked about more than just money but risks to the patients that occurs.Why was it less reliable? Why was it less reliable? Oh, that's why! Mostly talking about in the hospital then in homes.
