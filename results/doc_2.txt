Okay, out loud. In journal of adolescent health specific examples in California and Oregon, seeing how it is a screen shot, there are no ads all over it.Does not use contractions. Specific examples. Page not covered in ads. Journals and research. The news can be a little hard to trust sometimes. Okay, first things first, this is covered in ads.  Correct generational names, personal experience from the author. Covered in ads, biased without too much thought of other side. Ah, another thing covered in ads. I don't trust things covered in ads. They just look so stupid. There is a chart, charts are okay.  Interesting, but right off the bat, I give it a 4.5. Because of the chart, and all these reliable-looking things like from NASA. Okay, then we have to do an online search, which I don't even know what to do, I'll figure it out. Am I allowed to justice charts, national snow and ice data center, current data. Covered in ads open comments. Oh my goodness, it's still covered in ads. I can't handle this. Let's see Washington Post. Algorithms, that sounds smart. This one seems less Quote from president, Washington Post. I can see how this might be a little bit biased I'm not smart enough for this study, why am I doing this? What year was this? I can't read it.  Okay, it doesn't tell me what year it is. That's a little annoying. Covered in ads, year. I don't think they are lying. Oh, and it is also covered in ads. At least this one is recent. Survey, okay that is cool. Survey. Right now I am giving this a lower score.  I don't trust any of these. Covered in ads, very biased with no alternative argument, popup petitions just generalizing people. Do we have any quotes from any actual republicans here? No. They are all quotes from different people which is important, but it doesn't represent everybody. If I was interested in your petition, I would have looked it up.
