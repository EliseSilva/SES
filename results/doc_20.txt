See what that is. K,  Politically liberal American news and opinion website. Ok, and so it says right there that it is an opinion website. So, it's obviously very one sided.

K, so now I'm gonna look up theblaze.  Let's see what that is. American multiplatform news and entertainment network available on television. Ok.  Authentic and unfiltered voices.  Um, so it's a television network.  Seems to be pretty legit. I'd give it an 8 for its credibility. The website itself seems to be a very credible source. I also like that the author of this article cited his sources. For example, the graph would be pointless if it didn't say where it came from. It's hard to validate the reliability of such a controversial topic. People make stuff up. I see fake posts about stuff like this all the time. The website itself seems to be a very credible source.

So first I'm going to look up the Washington Post. Breaking news and analysis on politics, business, world national news. Ok, so I know that this source is reliable. Um,  Then I'm going to look up Elon Musk's SpaceX.  See what it says.  Advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2012.  Ok, so it talks about that in the article.  Alright. K, so this I know that the falcon 9 is a real thing.  That SpaceX is a real company.  Let's see.  Ok Talks a lot about the same stuff. The post is, or the website is a good source. I'll give it a ten  The Washington Post is a reliable source, it's a news company. Also the information is accurate and seems right. Nothing, the article seems great!More reliable: The Washington Post is a reliable source, it's a news company. Also the information is accurate and seems right.Nothing, the article seems great! Daily Kos K, so I haven't heard of this website before. And the article title seems really odd. I'm giving it a 1  Or, I'll give it a 2  to start off with.  Hmm, this seems right. K, so the information does seem accurate so far.  Ok.  So I'm going to start off again by looking up daily k-o-s. Ok, this site seems like really unprofessional. And I mean  it doesn't say anything about it.  K so it says it's compiled by  David Nir, I don't know who that is. A couple different people. So we will look them up.  Ok so one of the author is an elections writer.  Ok. Stephen Wolf.  Let's see who that is.  Ok.  That seems really odd. I don't know.  Hard to find information on the authors so that's not like a good sign, I guess. So I'll give it like a 6. The information seems accurate, I can see how this is a problem.
