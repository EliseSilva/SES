NPR Okay. Okay so,  hmm. I mean it seems pretty reliable. There's evidence in here of you know like it refers to like California authorized  Oregon passed a similar law  So like I mean I'm sure if I looked that up online that would be true. If that was something that was concerning to me I would look that up, but it seems pretty legit to me. Um kind of this bit that the law hasn't actually been changed  So it's just talking about, its general, like it's not, I don't know. It's not going to make a decision either way. It can't change the law.  This article is just talking about it in general. It's not making any major claims, it's just, it's general. Like I said. So it, if, like it's not. This might be bad, but it's not necessarily super concerning to me if all of the facts in here are right or wrong because it's not making any major claims. Um, so  I'd say, on a scale of one to ten, it's probably pretty reliable. I'd would feel a little bit more comfortable like putting closer to a ten if there was like I don't know, numbers or something. There's hyperlinks to you know research or the Krishna, I don't know how to say her last name  But like hyperlinks to them so I could look them up or click on those. If I wanted to know more about like the study or her and like why she says  there is a growing body of evidence that the safety risks are low and benefits are large.So, I'll probably give it like a seven.  So, high on reliability. Um, yeah. It's more reliable to me because It uses evidence/talks about the fact that it has been passed in certain states. It also doesn't make any major claims, so I'm not super skeptical of whatever the article is telling me. It's probably less reliable because like for me like I'm, I don't know. Like people under 18 are still required to first contraceptive prescription from a doctor.  So like  it talks about how like yeah we're still required to do that but like but there's obviously like a reason that people under 18 would be required to have a prescription, because they're young right. It's like if it's just over the counter and everyone would get it like, maybe there's no evidence yet,  but, but that's not necessarily that it's a less reliable source, that's just that, you know, there's not enough research to back up the claim, if this article is making it, that anyone  should have access to. It's not necessarily making the claim it's just saying that that is something people are looking at  it's not making any major claims so, like I said before I'm not super skeptical of whatever the article is telling me. It  tells me that people under 18 still need a prescription to attain their first contraceptives, but  then says that there is no evidence that it is harmful why would you need a prescription if it's not harmful? Just because there's no evidence doesn't mean it's not true. It just means there's not enough research YET. It uses evidence/talks about the fact that it has been passed in certain states. It also doesn't make any major claims, so I'm not super skeptical of whatever the article is telling me. It tells me that people under 18 still need a prescription to attain their first contraceptives, but then says that there is no evidence that it is harmful why would you need a prescription if it's not harmful? Just because there's no evidence doesn't mean it's not true. It just means there's not enough research YET. Huffpost A third way for universities. I'm not sure if this is true. The millennials and members of Generation Z, cuz that's me. Are calling for career specific education? Like, I don't think we're calling for it, I think the other generations are. Like, like our parents, aunts and uncles, teachers, adults are telling us that we need to be career specific because they have experienced that, you know, if you get an English degree, you know, unless you're like a really successful author, what are you going to do with it? You know. So, that's kind of my first thought about that. Okay so like, the author's establishing credibility right here.  Because he, or she,  I don't know if it's a guy or a girl. Paula. Paula is a girl. She has personal experience, you know she started this college of art and design.  So she's got some credibility, like she has this experience that she's sharing. Also, you know,  40 years and tens of thousands of gainfully employed alumni later, you know, we've been a success. So she's credible. I guess.  2Ok, well I personally would  find this maybe more credible because I agree with it.  Like  I want to be a teacher, and like talking here about, you know,  you have to revisit the existing degree programs and seek ways to update curricula to adjust to changing professions. It's backbreaking work, but no work is more important. I think that's true, across the board with education, like teachers have it hard you know. Like major programs, even like elementary school teachers who are teaching and they're teaching the same thing year after year after year after year. Like, it's gonna be a little bit outdated eventually and we're not going to be preparing students for the world that they're living in. So, I don't know, that makes it a little bit credible to me. A little bit more credible to me. It's something that I agree with and I've had experience with. Like, because I want to go into education, I want to be a teacher, I've seen that and I value that, I value that, you know, having education be up to date and really effective I guess. K, so I'd probably give this one like,  an 8.  Paula Wallace. K so, she's who she says she is. I mean, obviously, that's why.  Yeah I don't really know what  I'd look up to  make it more credible.  Again, like I think the biggest thing for me in establishing if a source is credible or not is like, like she's not making any like death defying claims.  There's nothing that's gonna, challenging anything that I know, so like I guess everything she's saying  is something that I agree with or  like I can kind of relate to. It all seems like it's based on facts. It's based on her personal experience at least. And her personal experience checks out, so I'd say it's still  I'll maybe give it more than that. Cuz now I know, I know that she says who she is and  I think it's pretty reliable. It's something that I agree with and  it doesn't make any outlandish or unreasonable claims. Nothing seems glaringly wrong with what she's saying. Um, what makes it less credible?  I mean I just glazed over, but it doesn't really feel like she really like,  I mean she does talk about like what's going on now, but like  I don't necessarily know what like the issue is I guess.  I don't know, it seems pretty credible to me so like not a whole lot is gonna make it less credible.  Maybe that it's a Huffington post Sometimes you find weird stuff on here. So I guess. It's a  Huff Post article. Sometimes you find weird stuff on there that may not necessarily be true. I'm pretty sure it's the Huffington post but,  Huffpost. Huffpost. Close enough.  It's something that I agree with and it doesn't make any outlandish or unreasonable claims. Nothing seems glaringly wrong with what she's saying. It's a Huff Post article. Sometimes you find weird stuff on there that may not necessarily be true. Theblaze. Global warming fail, study means or study finds melting sea ice is actually helping arctic animals.  Ok, it's different. Usually people are saying like  that its bad for the world. I don't actually know that much about Global Warming.  A graph.  Antarctic and Greenland, Land Ice lost.  Ok so it is helping the animals then, they're alluding to  that's obviously new that ice caps are melting.  And land ice levels are decreasing.  I'm pretty sure everyone knows that.  By global warming, unless mankind stops producing significant amounts or carbon-dioxide emissions, the world's animals will not be able to survive. Well, which animals? Kind of depends. Ok, so  it's a new study of research and that hyperlink would probably take me to what the research is. That makes it pretty credible, like I can go look at the information that they're basing their statement off of. What's a melt pond? Surprising benefits . Actually helping . Good conditions  Atlantic salmon.  Like generally it looks like it's probably true. Like it does have  good, like a positive effect on animals. So before looking that up, I probably would have said it was like an 8. Pretty, probably pretty reliable.  After looking it up, I'd say it's probably a 10. They've got lots of  like quotes and stuff. They've got lots of embedded articles,  hyperlinks, where I can go and look up the information. After  googling it, like I know that this is a real issue, that this is legitimate. Like it really is helping these arctic animals.  Like, maybe not certain species  Like some, it is put a. While rising temperatures have certainly put a strain on species in some parts of the world, so like it addresses both sides of the issues which makes it credible.  Cuz like you know they've done their research, they know both sides of the issue. That it is putting a strain on some species  but it's focusing on the arctic region. So, seems pretty credible to me.  Um, it's more reliable is. Lots of hyperlinks  so I can check their facts. It's got a graph. numbers generally are convincing. I guess.  Um, what makes it less credible?  Um, I think it's pretty reliable probably. Hard to say anything makes it less reliable. Maybe like sharing the articles on twitter or Facebook  that kind of makes me a little bit skeptical cuz sometimes  you know you click on a  link that somebody's posted. The fact that you can share it on social media because  people post stuff all the time that is completely I don't, I have no idea how you spell ludicrous. So completely...  Hmm, ludicrous, okay.  ludicrous. Lots of hyperlinks so I can check their facts. It's got a graph. numbers generally are convincing. The fact that you can share it on social media because people post stuff all the time that is completely ludicrous. The Washington Post Ok.  Musk's SpaceX makes history by launching a ˜flight-proven' rocket. Okay. There's a video. Videos are good. Videos make it easier to read an article.  Cuz you don't actually have to read.  It tells you. Um.  Okay, so it's flight proven, it's already made a launch. What's the point of this? That we can launch a rocket? I know we can do that.  The real goal is to dramatically lower the cost of spaceflight. Okay. Accessible company. So that's the point. Make it accessible. Takes a long way to get there  that's kind of annoying.  K, um the word computing  makes me trust the article a bit more I guess. Cuz computing, computer, computers are pretty reliable. Like they are only as flawed as, you know, the glitches in their programs. But, you know, for the most part like computers allow us to do a lot so like, I guess that verb, or adjective, whatever the word is, computing, describing the power like makes me trust it. Um, cuz computers kind have this connotation of being like flawless. Not that they actually are, because they're not flawless, but guess you get the idea. Reusability. Okay so this is talking about reusability .  Um, in general  I mean it's got a picture of the rocket . Rocket scientists are probably pretty smart  I'd say it's probably like a 9  Pretty,  pretty reliable. Um,  I wouldn't put a 10 probably because I don't know who Christian Davenport is Um it's in The Washington Post, that probably makes it pretty reliable.  But, I don't know, I don't have any background on the issue so I'd probably put a nice Just because I'm not 100% that everything they're saying is true. Um, it's more reliable it's From the Washington Post  I know that's a credible source. It's got a video which gives easy access to the info. Um, I think less reliable.  I'm not super familiar with anything in the space field. I'm sure it's a legit issue, but the lack of familiarity makes me skeptical. I tend to question things more the less background knowledge I have. From the Washington Post  I Know that's a credible source. It's got a video which gives easy access to the info. I'm not super familiar with anything in the space field. I'm sure it's a legit issue, but the lack of familiarity makes me skeptical. I tend to question things more the less background knowledge I have. Oh, oops. Probably still a 9. Ok, I definitely can relate to this. I have my CNA. I'm a certified nursing assistant, and I know that there's a crisis in like the care that they receive, the quality of care that they receive. A lot because there's a shortage of people who can give the care. And that's I guess the jobs crisis too. That we need, well, I don't know. Okay so this is saying it's become harder to fill those jobs.  Okay this is true. I would say it's probably pretty credible, just like a first glance.  Not really having read a ton of it because  like the title  I agree with it, it's recent,  April 2017, so that's just, you know, a few months ago, three months ago. So it's recent, that make it credible.  I'm going to get these down as I go. It's a recent article. I have my CNA, so I have seen this issue first-hand and can tell you it's really true. Okay, and like having hyperlinks  makes it look good like it looks like it's credible.  Having the quotes in-text  It looks good. I mean, I haven't read them so I don't necessarily know.  But like it looks pretty good.  Quotes are evidence which makes the article look credible. Um, what makes it less reliable? Um,  I don't know this less reliable is hard because I mean they're all probably pretty reliable. This is definitely an issue, like I know that this is an issue  Um 70% of administrators reported a lack of qualified job applicants . Nobody's qualified. They have a lot of PCAs now, which is the same thing as a CAN, you get paid less because you don't have the certificate of completion of like the course, but you do the exact same things. You're just trained on the job versus paying for, you know, a month long class to become certified. Um.  Hmm.  Ok so Medicaid. I know that's  true that people blame it, I mean, whether or not it's the cause I'm not entirely sure I haven't done enough research on it but um  I know that it's true.  I thought if anything it was going to make it less credible, again like I don't know what Daily Kos is  Daily Kos Labor  I guess it's like a labor news forum. Or something. Another thing that makes me kind of skeptical of articles is like what's on the sides, like all the ads.  If there's  like ads, that, you know, things you've never heard of, like I don't even know what this is Or  I don't like, Holiday Retirement, that one makes sense  But like all this stuff like,  I don't even know I guess these are other recommended articles. Or like, Ok,  this stuff, like you may like, promoted links, easy to fix, fix for constipation and bloating, Melanie Trump thinks we're stupid  stuff like that that you know people pay for their ads right, so people who are paying a little bit for a stupid ad that is some stupid article  like these make it less credible. Like if it were to have like a Ford or like, you know, somebody who's paying more for the article, it would be a more reliable source  because they're paying more to have it on a more reputable website  Um, but like, the cheap ads I guess. So,  cheap ads on the sides of the page also just cuz they're annoying also just a little bit because sometimes they're inappropriate too, which is a deterrent from reading the article. they can be obnoxious or inappropriate. It's a recent article. I have my CNA, so I have seen this issue first-hand and can tell you it's really true. Quotes are evidence which makes the article look credible.Less reliable: cheap ads on the sides of the page also just a little bit because they can be obnoxious or inappropriate. But,  overall I'd say it's credible  because I, I have prior knowledge, I don't even need to search stuff because I know that it's true.  I didn't read everything, but, so maybe it's not a 10,  but I'm going to put a 10 because I, from what I have read I know that it's true. Oh, beforehand looking at it, I probably would have put a 9  cuz I didn't know what they were going to say But, just like glancing at it, reading the title  looking at the picture  I know it's a CNA, I've done this before, I've put on the ted hose.  I mean, it looks pretty credible, surface value.  And after reading it, I agree with what, you know, the things that I read. And  there's nothing glaring that makes me worry about it.
