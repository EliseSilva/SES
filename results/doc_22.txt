Over the counter birth control pills.  We wrote about it and everything, that is professional.  Uh. It's fairly reliable. Even though I don't agree with its conclusion, but for the argument it's making for safety it's okay. Whoo. Okay, abstract.  Okay so the abstract is just talking about the fact that the oral contraceptives aren't dangerous for age. That's great but,  It's more an issue of does making it easier cause an increase in risky behavior. Or I suppose, I guess teenagers would do dumb things regardless. Hmm, that's a bad precedent. Oh, they even make the argument, of increased access, increased risk.  Mixed. . Demonstrated no increase.  It was written in 2007. Ok. Well ok there's no increase, but is there a decrease? Well like, do people actually use it?  I love how they abbreviate everything but not STIs. Hmm. Use of  scientific studies, does not extend the source material beyond what it  concludes. Slightly too informal tone of article, fails to address concerns of  Yeah, so it's more reliable because it sources scientific studies and it just says what the study says. And like a lot, a lot of articles like they'll be on the study but I guess the one issue is it doesn't. The study, when you look into it, mentions the, their view on how it's not going to increase um risky sexual behavior, but, the article doesn't point that out. So it leaves that concern. of increased sexual irresponsibility. Use of sourced scientific studies, does not extend the source material beyond what it concludes.Slightly too informal tone of article, fails to address the concerns of increased sexual irresponsibility.Well that's nice. Career specific.  No man, we can't do career specific, we gotta do the arts. Must adapt, I can always agree with that. Yeah, that's a good idea.  Savannah College.  Well I don't know how you check for reliability, it's more someone talking about their own opinion and  I guess it's reliable because they're learning how to pin, they have links, because it doesn't Let's see. The author is credible source for the topic, clearly writes  piece as an opinion, but backs opinion with multiple sources and good reasoning.I, I don't know, this reads really well, it's a really good source,  I guess the only issue is previous experience. Previous experience with Uh. With the news source. the news outlet. Huffington post isn't always reliable.  So, there's a little doubt in it, but this particular one is good.  And, uh and well all the ads I guess.  But, that's expected. The author is credible source for the topic, clearly writes piece as an opinion, but backs opinion with multiple sources and good reasoning.Previous experience with the news outlet. The blaze.  Global warming fail. Study finds melting sea ice is actually helping Arctic animals. That's a little bit of a, unprofessional lingo, but  yeah. The first one had it too. Alright it says here that humans are  primarily responsible for rising global temperatures long claimed wildfire are harmed significantly . Okay so, it recognizes the other side. I'd like a source from the other side though. New study  In Arctic region are thriving, well that's interesting. Ponds, life system, heat for the ice  Now this is the thing that's always confused me, I never saw global warming as a strictly bad thing, I mean, sure it changes stuff, that isn't necessarily bad.  Nutrients are able to reach the sea more easily because of all this.  Hm. That's an interesting graph. So over time, this is like a second derivative. Over time there has been a lot of decrease in Greenland but not as much in Antarctica  About 2 million, okay. They're using NASA. NASA is an extremely credible source. They give a number of how much is lost and how much remains. Climate change is a, oh.  There's a grammatical error. That's awkward. I'm not particularly hard on a single grammatical error. It's like come on, that happens.  Fairly credible.  It has all the same stuff so, oh, I guess a few more ads. But, eh. It doesn't change the article itself. Alright let's look at the sources.  University of Southern Denmark, okay.  So they mentioned the neutral effects from the NASA, and the decrease, how reliable is the University of Southern Denmark?  Press release. Ok so, they were confident enough to do a press release on it. Huh.  Yeah that's really credible.  Alright. Use of multiple sources, NASA especially, recognition of the other side while presenting how its conclusion may have been wrong,  gotta love graphs. Iffy title. Who wrote it? Justin Haskins. Use of multiple sources, NASA especially, recognition of the other side while presenting how its conclusion may have been wrong, gotta love graphs. Iffy title. Hmm. I solved the, the little ad at the top. Yeah that's, not what I'm here for, but x is 49 by the way  Hmm.  Ok, they got a video.  Hm. Lower the cost of space flight.  Well, it's reliable. I don't know.  It gave the information. There's a lot of quotes. It has the video to show that the thing it's talking about actually happened.  I guess it's more reliable cuz it's not really giving an opinion. Um, so it doesn't really need as much backing up of it, cuz it's just like this happened. Um,  what makes it different? Yeah it's more reliable than the controversial stuff cuz those last ones they only give their side, like they acknowledge the other side but even that blaze one didn't give a source for the other side. It gave sources for like neutral stuff or like yes, the ice caps are melting, it didn't. Just giving information on what occurred gets the whole scope of the  facts. Organized, clear title, video  proof of event. Just giving information on what occurred gets the whole scope of the facts. Organized, clear title, video proof of event. There's a growing crisis in care for disabled and elderly people. Oh and it's a job crisis. Unprofessional title, again! But hey, you gotta get the clicks somehow.  dollar an hour job, requires lifting an adult into and out of bed or the shower. Okay. As the economy improves, it's hard to fill those jobs. That's a negative. Hmm. I know there's positive and inferior goods, maybe there's positive and inferior jobs? That's interesting.  Hm, they have these little boxes Huh. Paid living wage. I didn't like the use of political lingo. Republicans are standing in the way of adequate funding, well I mean the alternate solution then, then you know making more government policy with Medicaid is just get rid of Medicaid. Whatever way is, you know, most beneficial but get the government out of the way so that the free market can adjust the prices to what will be efficient, yeah cuz it's an issue of the fact that because there's government involvement, it's inefficient.  So there's people who aren't getting aid, and they are willing to pay for it. Okay. One survey discovered.  Yeah that's not even particularly good sources.  It's just a lot of Separates quotes into blocks. Lots of political lingo and pre-suppositions that aren't supported very well, fails to address other solutions to the problem presented. Separates quotes into blocks.
