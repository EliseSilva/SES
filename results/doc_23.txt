Um, I'm just looking up the previous article about it.  Um, so I decided to look at the, the other link because I wanted to see what the evidence was for, um, why girls should be able to get the pill before eighteen.  Um, and yet it makes sense reading the second article, um, cause it said that there was a fifty percent unintended pregnancy rate, which was, um, given by a doctor who is the president of the American congress of obstetrician and gynecologists, so that seems pretty, um, legitimate. Um, yep. That's probably quite biased, , so I'm just putting it at a six.  Quotes from a reliable sources. Dr. James T Breeden, president of the American Congress of Obstetrician and Gynecologists.  Krishna Upadhya, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the John Hopkins University School of MedicineAlso linking information and stats from credible research papers, research journals. I feel like there should be opinion/quotes from actual girls who want this it shows that there would be a demand for it. I feel like the article is quite impersonal, takes it from a very removed perspective going to higher-ups and not talking to people where it will actually affect them. Um, well, firstly  this is a Huffington Post, um, article, which I usually, um, think , is quite biased, um, very liberal,  um, although I am a liberal laughs. Um, but  sometimes I feel like  their articles are quite, like, sensationalist and, um, kind of clickbait-y.  Um, but in saying that, just looking at this, um, it looks  quite professional, like,  it looks like a really good, um, well-thought out article, um,  and it was written by the president of unintelligible college of art and design, so in that way it's quite reliable. Um, the way that she's written,  it seems that she, uh,  um, is also, very like melodic and, um, it's just that she knows what she's talking about. Um, the only thing is, um, because she is the president, a unintelligible school, I feel like  she's biased because she can be a bit more, um, flexible with how she runs her courses. Um, so for more traditional universities, um, they would have to be a bit more focused to get the skills, um, but I, I like what she's saying  um, but I would just, I'd give this a six  as well. Um,  so I've just looked up the actual article, and, and clicking on a link . Um,  I guess it just tells you  that, um, their alumni  are successful  Um. Yeah, reading the other links it makes sense that, um, what she's saying is that a more integrated way of learning is more beneficial for students and I can agree with it um, and maybe I'm biased  as well because I'm a university student so there's something that I'm interested in. This probably brings it up a bit. Text written in the first text box: Paula includes references to her alumni that are successful in getting jobs- in a way this indicates causality that her integrated approach to learning does indeed help her students to get a kick start in their career path.Text written in the second text box: Paula is the head of a art and design college, which in my opinion has the leeway to be more liberal and flexible with the way they design their courses opposed to more traditional courses. Of course art colleges should prepare their students for careers culturally it is a stereotype that artists find it difficult to find work. This I don't think is a huge problem for my traditional courses like accounting  the theory based learning definitely prepares students for their careers, and internships are often usually what students will start applying for anyway. Um, just from the title, I'm not really convinced, it seems really, um, casually written and kind of, um, like click bait-y. Kind of like they are trying to  hard appeal to a young audience. Also there's a spelling mistake here it says, climate change is accompanies and  although it's just a typo, um, kind of reduces the credibility. Yeah and the fact that they've included this graph, um, it's obvious that the, the land unintelligible have decreased, but  I don't know how that would support their argument that this has been official, it just was stating facts. Um,  the link that they've supplied is also quite, um, unreliable, um,  the original article has link to this unintelligible Watts Up With That?and I, I don't know, I don't really think that sounds very professional.  Um, and  I feel like the unintelligible they've given is just very pointed toward whatever they want to prove.  Um. and  just looking at the original actual research article  it says nutrient availability limits biological production in Artic sea ice melt ponds.  That doesn't seem very positive actually, maybe um, I don't really understand this whole  article  but I feel like it doesn't  conclude that global warming is actually helping. They've given graphs and links to other sources. the graphs and sources don't explicitly help the argument that global warming is helping the ecosystem. They seem to be taking conclusions and changing the information to suit what they're trying to prove. Um, it just says here that these are unintelligible the Washington Post  which is the, um, news company that's published this article. Um, to be honest, I don't really understand the article very much. But, it just makes it, um, seem very biased. Um, I'm just skimming it over again to understand it. Um, I'd just give it a five. I don't really know what it's trying to prove, I guess it's not really an argument it's just describing things, so. Yeah, I'd just give it a five because  it's mentioned that it's somewhat biased towards the Washington Post, and,  um, yeah,  it's just describing the event. Just kind of looking it up, what it really is. So, I've gone to TIME, um, and I like TIME magazine, so yep, just see what, um, this is cause I don't really know anything about it.  Okay, so, um, this tells me that Elon Musk is kind of like a conglomerate, big business guy. Um. Okay so it's kind of told me a bit about  what Elon  Musk is unintelligible  laws. Um, cause I don't really have much background on this topic, I'm just reading that the author, um, unintelligible defense and space unintelligible probably knows what he's talking about. Put it at, at a 6. The author is specializes in space and defense industries, and because I don't have much background on this subject I'm going to trust that he knows what he's talking about. For someone that doesn't know anything about rockets, I feel like this article isn't really entry level friendly. Maybe if they defined some words and concepts- or used less specialized language it would be easier to understand. Um, I like how they've included this real-life example of how, um, of the implications of not having enough people um, to fulfill the roles needed and therefore declining care to vulnerable people, like it really  um, helps you to see how important it is. Um,  and looking here at the president and chief executive of leading unintelligible is really concerned about this and so it does make you worry and, um, feels more like a pressing issue. Um,  this I guess is going into politics, um because I am a bit more liberal it is something I would agree with. but yeah, that's a little bit tricky.  Yeah this, um, quote given is really, it's really, um, kind of taps into your emotions, um, and that really makes you see that this problem isn't just, um, about, like, the problem can be fixed from high up so that you can kind of, uh, solve the problems that are more close-to-home, if that makes sense. Oh, and it said, it kind of makes a dig at republicans at the end, making America great again. Um, but it does have a really good point, um, which I agree with.  Just gonna look, oh, here I'm gonna put this at a seven.  Um,  gonna look at what daily kos is. I've never heard of it before.  Okay, so it says that it's a group blog, focused on liberal American politics. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. so it's, it's pretty biased. so just looking at that I'm gonna put it down to a four  cause this seems  to be incredibly biased paper. Um, it is a political blog and  I like to look at things that have a bit more balanced.  Um, see things  from both sides. It includes quotes and stories from real people to help you to see the implications of government-level decisions can impact on vulnerable people. This is from a very biased news outlet/blog, so it doesn't really look at two sides of the story or weigh up any other options other than the fact that republicans are ˜ruining people's lives'. It needs to look at more reasons to be a more credible source- it can have sad stories but it should have more facts and statistics and maybe look at reasons why people aren't working in the nursing field.
