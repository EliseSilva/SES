So I'm going to check out this thing on NPR, just to see if it's a doctored thing to prove that I'm an idiot.  NPR is a very reliable source. There is nothing that this article shows that disproves this screen shot or source so I would say that it is very reliable, going to give it a 10. I like NPR also because they report on cool things that are not getting reported elsewhere. NPR is peer reviewed up the wazoo, so the fact that they are reporting on it at all indicates the validity of the issue they are speaking about, in this case, over the counter birth control. NPR quotes numerous sources throughout the article, including studies done about the effects of birth control on teenage bodies. Nothing about this particular article makes it seem less reliable. Generation Z? Full disclosure study people, I don't know who generation z is. Is that the one after millennials? Or are they Gen Xers who are now Gen Zers because they were at the end of Generation X. It's cluttered as a page but it doesn't look terrible. I'll also check out Savannah College of Art and Design just to see if this is a real college, or if it's like that movie Accepted where he makes his own university, that would be really funny. It doesn't seem like it would be unreliable. It's hard to know if this guy is straight up lying about the number of people that are employed from this school he created. I mean that's all he really has going on is that he's established an ethos through his ability to do things, as a creator of a college, which is pretty impressive, it's true. The ability of the writer to write coherently and interestingly throughout the selection was helpful. The writer was also a person of some academic stature and that made it more believable that he was suggesting authentic solutions to university and college issues. The adds on the side of the site were slightly distracting. The Blaze So, I'm already not, um, yeah, this doesn't look that good. It's on the Blaze, it's coming from a Christian source which isn't inherently bad but one of the headlines says Finally Hillary's vicious plans to overthrow Trump caught on video. Um, that's like a really loaded, weird and very Trump biased, as if Trump were some saint. It's kind of obvious that the person writing this thinks that human caused global warming is stupid when researchers show otherwise already. While rising temperatures have certainly put a strain on species in some parts of the world, a new study suggests animals in the Artic region are thriving because of higher global temperatures. That's such a glib way to just put aside like even though species all over the world are suffering from this here's one cool example and it's a way of making the one example sound bigger than the other small ones. It's a foolish sounding attempt to sound non-biased which is funny coming from a side that is obviously biased. I guess in regards to conservative things Louis C K has a really interesting bit. He talks about how it's bizarre to me that why would Christians be predominantly the ones that are against environmentalism when we're supposed to be stewards of the earth according to our scriptures. It's kind of unsettling. Also bad spelling, Climate change is accompanies can contribute¬ùthey don't even know! Sigh.  Clicks on hyperlink a new study. This is not linked to an actual thing so that's not great.  The fact that it does reference a study makes this more reliable. The way that the information is presented is incredibly biased and inflammatory towards people that believe in opinions in opposition to this writer. It serves to discomfort the reader. The amount of ads on the site are also obnoxious looking and make the site seem tackier. The fact that the site itself is the Blaze makes it less reliable to me because it is a site with an agenda and an obvious one at that. It subscribes more than some to conflict theory, the idea of us vs. them, which is unhelpful. Washington Post  Quotes from the people, details from the step by step process in which the rocket was shot off, and the writer's writing style make it seem more reliable.  Cool, I would say that it is very reliable. It was made more reliable by the fact that it was from a peer reviewed source, The Washington Post. The writer is clever, comparing fans of rockets to fans at a concert. It has footage of the event it is speaking of, and it quotes people involved and the sources closest to the event to give us the impression a correct one, I believe that we have more intimate knowledge of this event and issue as a result of reading this piece. Nothing stands out as making this article less reliable, other than perhaps the lack of links to sources to research for ourselves. This is excused by the fact that misquoting these people could be taken to court and they would be in trouble for libel. The research behind the article is helpful in making this more believable. The things that make this less reliable is the inflammatory tone against Republicans without elaborating on why it is the Republican party that is to blame. The article in general could have used more detail on what was causing the lack of care towards seniors.
