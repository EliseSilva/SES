This looks like a pretty reliable source, upon first inspection. It's about health, it displays pictures. Different things from the top, you've got the news, arts & life, music, programs, so obviously they do a variety of stuff on this website. Based on the little icon on the left, it says audio will be available later today. So obviously something is wrong there so that might decrease its reliability.  There is a link to another webpage, or another article in the bottom right hand corner.  As far as content goes, it seems pretty reliable.  They have pretty logical arguments and data.  They insert a quote from an assistant professor at a university school of medicine which, that's pretty reliable.  I'll probably give this an 8. Obviously there is some bias about it.  Cause it is one-sided. On view of the actual website there's a lot more ads and I can see scrolling to the bottom of the page they do a bunch more articles about different entertainment things so that would decrease its reliability.  Since it's not primarily about health and that sort of thing.  But still, I would say it's pretty pretty reliable. The quotes from acclaimed professors, the data, and the organization seem to present this website as mostly reliable. The ads, audio not working, and wide variety of article topics make this website less reliable about health and Birth Control Pills. Okay.  Next article. This is so weird.  Okay.  First opinion.  Ads everywhere.  Huffpost I feel like I've heard that before and it's not that reliable of a website, from what I remember and recall.  Yeah there's an ad right under the name of the website.  Okay, the writer looks pretty credible, 'President and Founder of Savannah College of Art and Design.' Although, I mean, I guess that's pretty reliable.  I also notice it was created on March 19th of this year.  And it was updated on March 20th, so maybe someone caught something wrong or they went back and fixed something about content.  And obviously it doesn't show the entire article from the screenshot.  First couple paragraphs don't really provide any data or evidence to the claims that they make.  It's a very opinionated and subjective viewpoint.  I can see that from the third, or I guess that's the fourth paragraph down when it says 'When I helped create the Savannah College of Art and Design and in 1978 I saw' blah blah blah blah blah.  So there's a lot of that type of thing in here, personal stuff.  Which makes it very biased to the writer's opinion. But I feel like the point they're trying to get across, 'A Third Way for Universities' is the title, they're trying to find a new way for universities to really adapt and change their lifestyle.  I feel like that in itself is a very opinionated thing, so if you're supposed to express an opinion then I don't feel like that should affect the reliability of the source. There should just be a disclaimer up front that, this is what you believe.  Probably rate this a six. Closes a few tabs and changes one to a google search of. Ads everywhere. I really like the picture, I know that's kind of off topic.  I could see that that's something, the picture right up front is how it captures the readers. Also something it does to captures people's attention is the three things they're trying to convey for the universities to adapt to.  It says first 'universities must adapt.'  'Second, universities should marry the intellectual and the practical in the same classroom.' And 'third, universities in their perpetuity keep the dream alive.'  Also underlines. And again as you scroll down there's all these other articles linked.  It says 'More,' 'You May Like' and all these articles which bring down its reliability.  So I would probably bring it back down to a 5. The writer is credible.  Content is subjective but thorough. The website itself publishes questionable things.  Ads again everywhere.  Links to random articles down below.  Revision? Goes to third article: Okay, next one. Again, more ads.  The Blaze.  'News, channels, my voice, radio, TV.'  This one, I guess you have to have an account to view, or there's some sort of special membership you get.  Get the Blaze newsletters if you wanna get whatever news they provide.  Yeah because of the signup and login thing in the upper right corner, obviously they do have some sort of exclusive something available if you're signed up to the website.  Actually, it has a share and tweet thing for Facebook and Twitter.  The other ones did too.  But something I noticed is this one has a lot of comments it has 167 comments.  Is that gonna be good or bad, I'd have to see the actual website to see the comments and what people are thinking. It doesn't really say much about the writer. Also the title Global Warming Fail: Study finds melting sea ice is actually helping arctic animals well that implies a whole bunch of things. First that global warming is actually a thing and that in the first place people thought they were hurting artic animals, so. I guess that's an assumption that makes it less reliable. Now for content There are some quotes from professors and there is a data chart. And the data chart is from NASA satellites so that boosts its credibility a lot so I'd say it's about an 8. So right when I opened the page there was another add that popped up in the lower right-hand corner. Ads are not good. I'd say on the comments they are pretty genuine, so that would boost the credibility if all these credible people are reading the article and are making intelligent comments about the article. But I'd probably still give it an 8. Because the ads and I know nothing about the author. The data and quotes from other primary sources. Data chart from NASA . No clue about the author. Ads everywhere still. Exclusive access for those signed up?  I mean I feel bad for the person that has to listen to all these recordings. Excuse my spelling and typing article. Washington Post, alright. Again ads. I guess that's the case with all of these.No clue what this is about. From the title. Probably this guy some sort of rocket, space-x or something. A launched rocket. It looks like it doesn't say anything about the author on the front page but it looks like there is a link where you can click on his name and find out more about him which would be more reliable if that is the case. I also look to the right and it has a most read column and almost everything is about Trump which is kinda funny. The content seems pretty unbiased. It does have elements from other people and different quotes. It has a quote from this guy that they are talking about in this second paragraph. It says 'a flight-proven rocket as elon musk's spaceX likes to call it' very specific the launch at 6:27. So it is very specific it has times, dates, quotes, seems decently reliable for something that the Washington post puts out there. I'd say 7.  Oh there's a video. That's kinda fun. So not only do they have quotes and specific times and dates they also have video which that makes it more reliable since it's a primary source taken from the actual time and place that they're trying to talk about. Yes so I scroll down below. There's 42 comments and it does have a little thing about the author. This guy covers the defense and space industries for the Post's financial desk. He was an author of some book. Seems decently reliable. I would say an 8 for that. the author been writing for a while and has written a book. Content is specific with dates and time. Contains primary source of the event: video. Ads. From Washington post. Woah. Ok. This one looks very chaotic upon my first view. There is a sign up/login button. Even the name of the website sounds sketchy. Daily Kos I guess? All the hashtags just seem like they are trying to catch peoples' attention.There's a bunch of tweets on the right hand side and tags on the left. These articles seem kind of similarly structured with the ads and the whole formatting of the webpage. Pretty much the article talks about how elderly people are not getting the care they need because of the nursing assistant position is not getting enough recognition or pay for what they do. There's quotes and stuff, but there is. It says something about a survey in Wisconsin which I don't understand why they would only do the survey in Wisconsin if they are making a general assumption about the public. Content is a little vague. Probably rate this a 5.  I'm probably going really slow. It says to take 2 minutes. Oop. Right when I got to the website that pops up in the middle of the screen . There's another ad right there . Man these ads. Scroll down there's ads. There is a lot of people's opinions on the subject. There's lots of comments. Laura Clawson. doesn't really say much about here.  she even commented on her own writing. I don't like this one. I would say keep it at a 5 but it's still not good. some content is backed up by evidence. Not completely false information. survey from only Wisconsin? Ads. Author commented on her own post saying, tip jar.¬ù Tags and tweets not very reliable trying to grab peoples' attention.
