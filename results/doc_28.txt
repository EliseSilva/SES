Shots. Health news from NPR Okay, just checking the date of this article. So I guess I usually do that. If I see a date, and it's easier for me to find it, usually, on the internet. I also, when I see resources, I check the links. I'm not really that used to the websites here, so I would usually do some research on the website. If I just saw this, and it seems to be, NPR news, maybe from a radio station. KUER 90.1. Whatever. So it says that 5 years ago. Something good about this, is that it has, this color words that might be a link if it were a real website. So I would just click there and try to check some of the sources, to check that the article is actually saying what those resources were. And I would usually check those websites to see how reliable they are. I would like, try to search some things there, try to find out if those links wrote real information. If I simply say, if I just think about the screen shots, it looks quite reliable. It has an author, it has a date, it has some links. I would say it's an 8 because I don't even know this website. Like I haven't regularly seen it. Maybe over time in, if I got more used to reading news, and finding out these resources, like these website, I would rate it a 10, but for not, just because I don't really know, I'm giving it an 8. So let's start by NPR. So I get to the NPR website. It looks like a normal news website. So it has different sections It has different news. Let's see it's a radio, under news, it has us, war, politics, let's just go to world. Okay, maybe I've been to this website before. Yeah, I think, I've seen some of the news before. So I think might have been to this website before. So let's get back to the webpage. Let's see if I can find the same article of this. Search. searches npr website search bar for over the counter birth control pill.See here it, I found the exact same thing. So let's see all things considered, what it is.If I'm looking for some information about this, I think it's a radio show. Names. Well, contact the show, I guess that's, let's see if the contact link works. Okay, so there is a real contact link which means you can contact these people and they really did this article. Rebecca Hersher, who is she? Let's see, I click on her name, and the first tab, story or, I don't find much about her. It's interesting because there's not much about her. I'll just keep scrolling down, just in case. There's some more news. Let's just google her name, Rebecca Hersher. I'm interested to find out. She seems to be interested in health news by the sort of news she writes about. I'll just google her. To see if she has any background in America. Okay, so I find, pretty much the same link. The news. Wow, she's on twitter, maybe she's on something like linkedin. Can't really tell by this, if she's the same person. Yeah, I don't normally go to twitter. So this might help. So it's muckrack, producer of weekend all things considered. So I want to see about her. Okay, search, okay, so she is a journalist, she seems to be a journalist, so I'm going to say it's reliable.I think I'll give her a 9 now. Well, she's worked at different radio stations. Let's see, something else I should check is whether these links works. Yeah, it sends up the links, yeah, so the links are valid. Let's research some of these people, Krishna Upadhya. Okay, she is a doctor. Let's see if she said that. Let's see if these are. So the Miama Herald is a known newspaper. So the Miami Herald actually quotes NPR, which makes a lot of sense. And teen vogue, I can't count on this one for health issues, but I think if the Miami Herald is quoting them, then it gives them certain support.  I can't really find, say much more on this, to say it's less reliable. The abortion rates have fallen, that's interesting. Let's see if this is a reliable information. Abortion rate in US falls to lowest level since roe v. wade. According to what I see on the news here, it seems like, I mean it's everywhere, it seems to be. Interesting news. November 2016 is the first source that I find. So how about here, abortion rate falls to lowest level since 1973, but no credit given. Let's see why, why is this. So why is it, why is it. Interesting, so abortion drops. Let's I think it's quite reliable. I only see, Rebecca Hersher is not a doctor. But what is the chance that they will have a speaking, making like a radio program. Sometimes it happens, but it doesn't mean it's not reliable. But it would make it more reliable if she was a doctor. So this little detail, I don't think this would be a big deal. I mean she's saying that researchers say, that all oral contraceptives would be safe for teens, she doesn't say I'm a doctor and I say it's okay. So maybe I should look for, the reason why, like, over the counter, search like over the counters. So I wonder if, just because there's a law passed doesn't mean. There's no version of the pill approved. So this is interesting. This is a big deal. If it hasn't been approved, it means that some more testing should be done. So maybe it's not so reliable to not need a prescription. So you can already tell. Approved by FDA.More reliable: I was able to find the article in the npr website. The screen shot had a date, the author's name and as I read other articles she had written, it seemed that she works with news related to health issues, so she knows what she's talking about. Also, I googled her and she's worked in different radio stations. Also, the links in the article are valid, they take the user to the initial website. By reading the article it seems to me that you cannot really tell whether Over-the-Counter contraceptive pills are safe for teens because they have not been approved by FDA so maybe they are not all as safe as they seem. Let's see. Okay. Huff Post. I don't really many of these sites. So I don't know. Paula Wallace, a contributor. So she might not be a journalist. President and found, Savannah College of Art and Design. A third way for universities. Okay, so she's in a university, so she knows what she's talking about, she has knowledge of it, she works in it.Date. There's a date. And okay, an update. In addition, people like to pick sides So there's a whole article. So this, I think this is like an opinion about the topic. So it means that there's not going to be real facts that can be proven, but still, it quotes places and names. Another. Maybe I should just do some googling on that. I want to read the article a bit more. Okay, so I think one thing that I would do, I would probably google the SCAD, like the website, and what their approaches are, to see if what she's saying is really what she she's listing.I think that there's not much to be said, she's just giving her opinion. Okay, here at the bottom. Okay, so I bet if I just google, I'll find this article. It would be much better to have the links to follow to it, but let's give this one a 7 for now.And now the two minutes, do some research. Okay, so let's start by the Harvard Business Review. Michael King.Let's see who this guy is, and why he says Collaboration. Let's see if we can find. Okay, why higher ed and business need to work together. I'm looking at someone's answers came to me. Let's see if this article, if I can find it. So this is the Harvard Business Review, and it seems to be, okay, an article written by Michael King. It makes sense. I usually look at the second part of it or third, because the introduction doesn't answer my question. Yeah, totally agree. Exactly. Sitting in a classroom just listening to a professor doesn't prepare you for the. I'm getting out of the point, here. Okay, so this link. Okay, so I'm just searching curriculum implements. Yeah, if I want to it be known, if it's reliable, I should really read the entire thing, both times. Okay, so that's not exactly.I'm not really sure that Harvard Business Review by Michael King suggests that collaboration between. Yeah, I think that would make it reliable. I'm not really sure about curriculum implement thing. Let's check her school, so it's Savannah College of Art and Design. Interesting picture. University for Creative Careers.Academics. Programs. I think that if she really wanted to show that this university is different than other universities and colleges, she should give more information on that, on how the approaches they use, not just the programs, but where would I find something like this.I'll look at life. Orientation. Student involvement. I don't know Reading tabs. Let's see what her point is with this. It's a question of careers. Career services. Careers, let's see. Academics. Programs. So they've got. Advertising degrees. Let's see the different degrees. MFA  in advertising. It seems like she gives a lot of nice detail for careers. Okay, so I think she got her point with. Let's give it a 7. I don't know if she really makes her point through the whole article. Let's start with the bad things. I didn't really look for her. Huh, interesting. A third way for universities. Paula Wallace. Let's see who she is. Okay, she is the creator, okay, she's president, actually, of the university. Interesting. You can clearly see who the writer is, the date, and she is the founder of a college, SCAD. She writes about giving students more options, more experience and as you see the college's website you can see that they achieve their goal. She doesn't include links to the information she's quoting.I've never heard of this college, but it seems like a nice place. Ah, let's see about this. The BlazeWell, I didn't really look for more information on the previous website, but maybe I should have done it. But let's look for the Blaze.  Ah, I doubt that. Justin Haskins, who are you, Justin? There's not information about you.I should actually see what sort of news are from this place. So plenty of stories. Seems to be a tv channel, a radio. Let's see what sort of information.Get rid of belly fat. Laughs. When they just, come with this belly fat thing, I stop thinking they're reliable. Politics, blah blah blah.The advertising here is the advertising I see everywhere. Which it wasn't with the previous sites. This one.So let's. The news are not divided by section as in the previous websites. I don't know. I'll just click on any of this. They just copy and paste from. If you go to the writers, it just tells you where, it doesn't show. Global warming fail.Find the new. I wonder who's in charge of this thing. Justin Haskins. I wonder, I don't know, it seems to me that it's biased a little bit. So let's see who you are Justin haskins. The name of the poor guy.  I really don't like this guy, I think. So this guy, is still not what his news, has to do with politics. And the titles on his news articles are kind of silly. It seems to me that the guy just has titles on fun, interesting topics, hot topics, but I'm not too sure how well he knows about these things. Maybe he just wants likes and comments. I don't really know who he is. Let's see the University of Southern Denmark. Cause March 30. Maybe this guy just copied and pasted it. Cause the link doesn't go to initial, it went to the. I don't find information that tells me about, I mean who in the universe has said this. It doesn't have a name. here. Heidi Louise Sorenson. Studied the phenomena I'm not sure I fully trust the PhD who tested this. Ecology, marine biology, microbiology. So she does research on this topics. Okay, it would take me forever to read this articles. So back to the first one. What did I do? I think this one is less reliable than the other ones if I just see it. Okay, I think this. Okay. Let's be objective in this. So if I just see this screenshot. I see the image. But I don't see who Justin Haskins is. The advertisement here is just kind of silly. They're all about these like hot topics, but I don't what they're talking like to me. How to fix cracked feet  what does that have to do with global warming.  I know. Advertising is just silly sometimes with articles. You can see date the article was published, the name of the author and some links that take you to the initial articles he's quoting. It has graphs and values that seem to support the article. Unless you search the writer, you don't know who he is or what he does. Once you go to the website you sort of find out that the news don't seem to be written by journalists, they are sort of politically bias. Also, his articles are not focused on climate change so you cannot really tell he knows with certainty what he's talking about.The advertisement on the site seems to be websites where they just get paid for clicks, so the site doesn't feel very reliable to me.I really think that when you can see the date the article was published. Oh, I have to. Oh, I didn't rate it. It has a graph and things. That's important. Washington Post. Okay, this is a good site. It has most rate news. Yeah, the Washington Post wouldn't write just any silly thing. I don't know who this writer is, but it's quite a reliable site. Let's see what else it says. So it has some dates on the launchings. And okay, it has, it says some information about SpaceX president, to see if it's labelled. Okay, I'm just going to leave it here.
