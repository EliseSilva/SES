Okay, so I just opened up the first site, it's the shots with health news from NPR. And I'm, yeah, I just started looking it, so I don't really know what I think so far. It is a .org, which usually seems to be more reliable than a .com. So that already puts me at a little bit, but not too much, because can still go on and create a .org. So, first of all, in the title, it says researchers say which already supports its argument, but it doesn't give me any specific researcher yet. This is a study from 2017, which is the current year, which benefits this article even more, because it's recent, obviously. Let's read some of this stuff. Okay, I'm going to skip down to the bottom, so I read most of it, read a little bit. So I'm looking for sites, to see if they cited anything here at the bottom. I don't see there looking at bottom of page articles, but they do have some sites in text. Let's take a look at some of these things.clicks on hyperlink to ACOG. So we have the, okay, so this is good, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Another thing that looks pretty real, and it does have another link at the bottom, so that's as good as a study. It does list some stuff like the ACA here, let's see so, it said, Patty Murray, D-Wash, introduced a bill in 2015. So stating a senator, kind of helps it there, a little bit. It doesn't seem like it would be the stronger site that I'd use, definitely would use some of it, if I was writing a paper on, say, birth control, but it wouldn't be my main citation or source. So I'm going to go ahead and give that one a 6 on how reliable it is. Just typing, could of said. flipped back to the article. Just thought of something else that makes it a little better too. Structure of the article is actually very organized. Separated into paragraphs that each have a little main point or support, and you don't have to read every single paragraph. It has big statements, as a result It gives things like that. So the structure obviously does help me out. If it was sloppy and all over the place, I would not want to use it in my essay.Bad things about this one, it seemed really short, so I don't know how much study you could actually put in that. By all means, some short things have a lot of points in them, but the longer it is, the longer the better I feel about it. The best is about 2-3 pages long. This one seems about 1 and a half.I know I said the links were good, but I feel like there should be more links and that would be better. Not on every single thing you do, but every time you cite someone or you say this professor did this, there should be a link there.Yeah, that's about it for this survey. It is a .org site which, for me adds a little credibility to it. Better than a .com. Also has a few links to other pages which provides additional reassurance. Structure of the article is good. Seems shortMore links”on every site or reference elsewhere. Okay, so just looking at the screenshots of this article, it's the third way for universities by Paula Wallace, and I'm looking at it, and the paragraphs look kind of big. It looks like it has a lot of information, I haven't really read anything yet. There are ads on the side, I don't like ads. It just seems to, they're there to kind of get the ads out there as well as their paper instead of just like the opinion in the paper.So the author, president and founder of the Savannah College of Art and Design. So that sounds pretty strong, president and founder, some big words in there. That obviously is meant to reassure readers that it's somebody important. However, if you look later, it says art and design, so um, that kind of lowers it because art and design, might be a cool major or something to be in, but it doesn't seem like you have much information, it just kind of paints a picture of somebody painting a picture, or doing some kind of sculpture or something like that. And it doesn't really reassure me, there. So I'm going to go ahead and on my first glance at the article. I'm going to go ahead and give this one a 5, actually let's go with a 4. I'm going to go ahead and open a new tab. Let's search it up real quick. Here it goes. I'll have it pulled up. I'm seeing a lot of the same things. There's still ads there, that I don't like. Let's see. I remember I said that there were no sites at the bottom, but I realized that you cite stuff in text nowadays. The title.The title, a third way for universities, is kind of confusing. I don't really know what it's trying to get at.  And then it has the date underneath, 2017 again. I love how it's in the year. Always like the closer it is. The other thing I was going to say is that this one is a .com. Those are a lot easier for me than a .org. So that, I don't like that one as much already. I'm going to go ahead and read some of this stuff and see what it says. Okay, so one thing I don't like in here. This is kind of opinionated, actually really opinionated. It cites Steve Jobs, that is apparently related or tied to CNN. And recently CNN has kind of come out and said it lied about a bunch of stuff, and Trump, of course, has called them fake news and everything, and CNN has kind of taken a downfall. So seeing them in this article is not helping me, because it makes me feel like these people are not using good sources to cite some of their information. So that's one bad thing I don't like about this. Okay, so I just clicked in to one of the links that they had in text over there. Right after, it's the first link, where she starts out by saying in this paragraph that her school, her college, offers a lot of different stuff.  It started off small, then it went to big, then it success, of course. I clicked on the link, it's an employment study. In an economic characterized by the convergence of globalized commerce, widely available information and rapid technological progress, innovation and entrepreneurship are crucial. Okay, from a Forbes magazine, so not the best place to go. Reading here, 98% of undergraduate and graduate students are being employed within 10 months. And 99% of graduate master's degree graduates are, who are being employed. So 88% are working, so that definitely supports it. Because I look how it's reporting on, which that means they've done a study. Well, hopefully they've done a study, I don't know for sure. I like how it gives numbers; numbers definitely strengthen an argument.So that's really good, I like it a lot. So let's keep reading down here. So it looks like this article is saying, because from its title and introduction, I didn't really know what it was getting at. That's kind of unconvincing, there. You need to kind of state your thesis so we know what's going on. So it looks like it's giving steps on what universities need to do to become like her university. Now, I don't really know much about her university, so I don't know why I would want to be like it yet. Now, she did give some good information about that, numbers, percentages, everyone's employed. So that does help me out there.Let's see. That's about it for that article. Let's see about how they say things. I just clicked on another link. The title is colleges are going online to crowdsource donations, and they're raising millions.Okay, so looks like it's another article, but this one, it's not about the alumni. Kind of saying that they could help fund something or other. Helps out. Oh, I see, they're using that link to show how they're bombarding alumni with all these asks for donations. And then it says consider offer graduates more than an upturned palm. Okay, so saying they serve students. So one bad thing I think about this is that it gives a link to how universities are bombarding alumni with asking them to ask, but it doesn't give anything much except opinion about why the school should help, continue to help alumni. Especially how that would lose them money, and things like that. So I really don't like that. So I'm going to type the things that I thought about this article.Okay, so after reading that, though, I'm going to have to give it a 3.5. I didn't like that one much. Didn't convince me of what they were trying to do. Structure was well. Date is relevant.Gives numbers in link Structure was okay. CNN is sited been exposed recently Did not like the way they talked with the audienceIs a .com don't like thoseNot enough support through linksThat's about it for that one. reads the title. Okay, so first off, this is contradicting a lot of things that people think about. my first reaction is, this needs to have a strong argument. Because before me, especially since I've been in my writing class recently, I've learned to, as I'm reading, to be unbiased, to keep my mind open, so I don't like picking a side of the argument and choosing, I kind of want to be open so that I'm not hard set on one thing and that reading the article will do nothing except make me mad. I want to be able to have my mind changed. So I'm kind of open to this, but there's a lot of stuff that says that global warming is actually bad for the polar caps, the ice caps and everything. So it's going to need some powerful arguments and also counterarguments to help do that. However, that doesn't really tell me much about how good this argument is or how reliable. So, I'm kind of going down and look. Ads, again, it seems like every article online has ads, so I don't know whether or not to disregard that. If I see one without ads, that would definitely help it a lot, but Look at that. So there's a graph here. So that's a bonus. 2 million square kilometers. Okay, sweet. So this one's looking really solid. So I'm going to start off by giving this one an 8.  Really strong.I'm going to go ahead and open a new tab.Here we go. Article is pulled up. I'm going to go ahead and read this, so I'm going to be quiet for a few. So I've gone through most of the article, looked at some of the links that it has on here. What I found was that the links are very solid, good links, take you to other studies or things like that that support the evidence and kind of explains what happens when the ice melts, cause this is an ice cap warming. So I was looking at it. Really like the links. They have a graph in here. Graphs are amazing support for almost anything. Really benefits this. Especially if I'm like looking through, and then, I don't really want to read the article because it takes too much time going through all these articles for research, so I kind of go through, look at what links they have, click on some of them, see how they look, and then especially this graph. This graph would make me want to stop and read it. Very important there.So kind of have a good conclusion. I know that the writing might not affect most people's, whether or not they want to read it. But if I'm reading it, and the writing's good, then I find internally, that I think it's just instantly, immediately more reliable. Sometimes it's not, and I know that they're meaning to do that, but if the writing's good, I find it more reliable, and even if I try to withdraw myself and look at it, it still seems a better choice than other ones that may have better, be more reliable, but not as organized or things like that, then I definitely don't like it as much. So if I go back to the page, and give it a rating based after I've read it and looked at it a little more, so my first rating was an 8, and I think I'm going to keep it at an 8. This one is in fact a .com, so any person could have made it, but people still go research things, and know it, especially if they have the sites and the links here. Because I know I do that kind of things, and I want people to read mine as well. I don't give too much credit to the .com/.org, whatever that is, I don't give it too much credit, but it is considered every time. So that's practically it for that one. I'm giving it an 8. I'm going to type my answers down right here. So just give me a second and I'll be on to the next ad. Love the structure and the way the writer talks. Links were very supportive. Recent Graph and Data. .comSlightly informal. Nothing extremely bad though. All right, next ad here. This one is Musk's SpaceX makes history. reading title.So apparently this ad is about a rocket, of course. So looking here at some of the things, this seems like a fairly short article. I don't see a single link, and I only see 1, 2 pictures, so not really making money, not opinion very high. So I'll start this one off about halfway, 5. We'll give it a 5 based on just looking on it. Go ahead and open a new tab if you give me a second. Okay, so I've just pulled up the page. So this is actually pictures, a video. So I'm going to go ahead and watch this video, or part of it. See what it's saying. It's put first, so obviously they want me to watch it.clicks ahead in video, then to end. Okay, so I started skipping ahead on that a little bit because it got boring, watching the same thing over and over. But obviously they launched this rocket and it was a success. Honestly, that did nothing for me. So I'm going to start looking for other stuff. Okay, I really don't like this. I can deal with ads on the side. But when there's ads on the middle of the page, I really don't like the article. It does not make me happy. And there's one right here. So not a good impression. So I'm looking at it, kind of just, so this article isn't seeming to try to convince me of anything, just explaining this rocket, and how it went through. So if I'm judging the reliability, let's start from the top. So let's go ahead and look at the link. Washington Post. That's pretty strong title, seems real. It is a .com, so iffy there, but the Washington Post provides an extra boost there.The video obviously shows the rocket, so you know the rocket's real, and it's been launched and what not, if that's the actual rocket, so that provides support there.They do draw you in, but there are no links. I guess it doesn't need links because it's just informational. But I would like to see some links to other websites, talking about this rockets, to know it's real. And it doesn't give me any of that. So if I had to, so they didn't have a second video like I thought. So on the bottom, it gives a little thing on the author, I didn't see this before. Covers defense and space industries. Okay, okay, sweet, that really helps out the article. So apparently the author covers the defense and space industries, and has served as an editor and reporter covering military affairs. That really backs it up. I love that. So I'm going to write that down.This has been since 2000. So he's been on it for a while. And that definitely helps him out. It makes him seem like he knows what he's doing. Definitely would believe this article. I definitely think it is true. And credibility. So if I'm to do like the online research for the credibility, earlier I gave it a 5. I'm going to have to take this one up to an 8 on how reliable it is. I don't know, it didn't really interest me, but for reliability, a good 8, maybe 9. Let's go with 9, actually. So that's the idea that I have for that one. Actual footage of rocketAuthor is a reporter that covers military affairs since 2000 on it for a while. Knows what he's doing. Ad in the middle of the page. Links More than one source. Let's see this. reading title. So that's the title. Don't like the wording with that. Seems very informal. Which means, it doesn't mean this, but it seems as though some person just got on, and is trying to talk to you like a friend, don't really know what they're doing. So that's the downside to that.I want, yeah, what I want from an article, is strong facts, I really like that, I want sources, and then the person needs to sound professional. The more professional they are, the more reliable they are, or they seem to be. So this is .c.  actually a, looks like a, actually, I don't know yet. I haven't looked it up. So based on the first look, pictures, got some links, sweet. So I'm going to give this one a 5, it seems informal, but it does have some good stuff. And it looks solid, too. Okay, article has been pulled up, so. So there's this little thing, 40 comments listed at the top of the article under the title. 40 comments. Let's go ahead and take a look at these real quick.So this person seems convinced. This person provides a counterargument, and then someone answers. So a lot of people, at least a lot of the comments, seem to be in favor of this article, but that's to be expected, seeing as how people who don't seem to be in favor don't seem to comment as much. So that's interesting. So that, I'm kind of thinking about it. I don't know what to think about the comments. I never saw this on anything else, but that doesn't mean they weren't there. So I'm going to go ahead and look at the links here, and what it's just saying, so give me a second, I'm going to go silent for a while.back to article. Okay, so skimmed over the article, and it seems pretty solid. It's an argument trying to convince us that caregiving, or caregivers should be paid more. And to, jump into action about that. So let's go over the things that make it more kind of reliable. First off, it has the links. There's a link about a survey, the survey is a .org, and then it also has a bunch of charts and graphs on it, and they explain them thoroughly there, which I love. I love graphs and charts, as I stated earlier. However, I don't like how, it's really bugging me how it seems like it's some person that just wrote on the internet, did a little research, and then had a bunch of people comment on it. That doesn't seem right to me. Makes me kind of think, like she might even be a caretaker herself and just wants to earn more money instead of going to school for something else. So, let's see, I'm going to go ahead and click on the author's name. Contributing editor. Interesting. So she is a writer, that's for sure. However, yeah, she seems very friendly, so like. I'm going to go ahead and put as a bonus, that she is a journalist, but she seems biased. And that seems to lose me when I'm reading an article. Another thing I didn't like, I said this already but the comments. Sorry. It's kind of hard to keep up with the microphone and keep up with the typing it down. So I might repeat a couple things. So let's go ahead and look at the rating for this one. I'm going to keep this one at a 5. Because it does seem like a valid argument. But it also seems really biased, and that she just wrote it because she wants everyone to do what she wants as well.  So does not convince me at all on that. Graphs and charts. Very supportive. She is a journalistTitle is too friendly. Seems biased. lose me Comments. Looks like that was the last survey. So I'm going to go ahead, it's asking me what to mark, on how reliable the source is. I'm going to mark that stuff off.
