Okay, so this article, looking at it looks like some sort of news website or news station, so it's better than most websites so far. It looks like it is providing links to some of its sources, that's good. I can't really tell who it was written by, well I can, I doesn't look like she is a professional. Let's see. The researcher, maybe? That would give me more information on whether she is reliable or not. So it looks like she has lots of articles, so she must be good at something. She is a journalist. She looks like she has some experience. I feel like I would trust her to give me some information, but I feel like I would need more to back it up. But I think I would keep doing more research, this wouldn't be a primary source for me. Oh, so I wasn't allowed to do research for the first part. So, before I was sort of iffy about it, so it would be more a 4, and then after I did the research, more of a 7.  It has an org at the end, I've been taught those are usually more reliable, probably not true now that I think about it. Usually sources with .org at the end tend to be more reliable than those with .com. The author also seems to be qualified, having some experience. She has many articles so she must be good at her job. I haven't heard of the website before, so that makes it less reliable. I also have not heard of the author before.I have heard of Huffpost before, so that makes it seem a little more reliable to me. And after the author's name, it says President and Founder of the Savannah College of Art and Design. So I feel like that makes her more reliable, she has a college, so that's good. That ad on the side doesn't seem to make this source more reliable, seems they need funding. I'm not sure I'm seeing any sources listed, so it's based solely on her reputation. I'm sure I would use this as a source, but again, not as a primary source. It look like they are citing CNN, they are usually reliable. I think I would give this one a 6.  So she has a nonprofit, an accredited university for creative careers she is sounding more and more reliable. It seems like it's a good college, too, not just a community one. She's founded teaching museums she is seeming more and more reliable. Let's read into this article a little bit more.  So she is talking about applying these new concepts to her school, and I feel like she would be a good source for that, because it is based on experience. And she's had a lot of it. I'd say this is a pretty good source. It's not amazing, so I'll do 9. I still feel like they could be a little bit biased, so The author is accredited and the founder of a college, even though I have never heard of it. The Huffington Post is popular and well-known. Cites CNN as a source.Well it seems popular, so maybe I'm just completely unaware of that. So maybe it is pretty reputable. I have never heard of SCAD. Not many sources are attached. I have never heard of the author. I feel like that's familiar, but I've never actually visited the website. All those ads on the side, those are usually ads I find at the bottom of teen gossip websites. How to fix cracked feet. Why the Amish keep these practices a secret yeah, it's not looking too reliable. Justin Haskins is the author. Again, never heard of him, but I probably haven't heard of most of these people.  Well, they are using a new study by a university, so that is good. Universities are usually reliable. Let's keep reading. They are citing the sources, that's good. There's data! Is this still from the college oh, 'Data released by scientists at NASA.' I would say, just by looking at the screenshot, that this is probably an 8.  And doing more research. let's see.  It's available on television, so I feel like that makes it more reliable. Ha, not that the television is very reliable, but they are popular, so I feel like most of their sources have to be correct. . Oh, he's only got 3 followers, that's a little sad.  It looks like they are into politics, so this (referring to global warming) must be really out of their comfort zone. So I feel like it's still an 8, but I sort of want to go lower, just thinking about those ads on the side. Maybe I'll adjust the 1st one, because I forgot to include the ads in my thought. But because I found out they are a television network, I think I'll go up to 8. but they also cited NASA, so 9. They cited NASA as a source and the Blaze is also available on TV, so most of their sources are expected to be reliable. The ads on the side bar are concerning. The author doesn't even have his own wiki page, which most popular authors have. Just from the name, I know they are usually very reliable, and they are incredibly popular. Christian Davenport, that name actually sounds familiar, I feel like I've read something from him before.  They have a video, so I'm going to assume most of the writing will include observations from the video, and that's a primary source. But I feel like it looks like that is the only source they have. Oh, they have quotes from Space X's president, so that's good. Looks like they have a few primary sources. It's mentioning other companies. I feel like usually Washington Post is really reliable. And just because I recognize the name and they mention a few good primary sources, it's a 9.  Actually, maybe it would be a 10, because I feel like I could use this as one of the main sources in my own article. But also yeah, so far there is no reason to doubt its credibility and reliability. So, researching. I'm unsure if this is the correct one. This one is a professor of government and politics. Let's see.  Yeah, so the first one I found was not him. He's just a reporter.  Okay, so space is sort of his thing, I would assume he is pretty knowledgeable about it. All his posts go back a little bit, he's not new to this. He was editor on the Metro Desk, worked at Newsday, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and Austin American-Statesman, and is the author of this. Is this a book or another article?  So it's a book. I would assume he's pretty reliable, then. And he comes from the Washington post. Still a 10. The Washington Post is popular and known to be credible. The author is well known and has written a book. He has experience with writing and editing. Space is also his main focus, so we can assume he knows a lot about what's happening. He used primary sources.Did I say he cited NASA?  Nope, that was the previous one. He also used primary sources, though. I guess the only thing that made me question the reliability were the ads on the sides for online games, and loans. But they don't have as much as the Blaze, that means that are doing pretty well off on their own. I still think it makes them incredibly credible, but that is a little sketchy. The ads on the side for loans and online games.Just starting at the top and going down, it seems to have a lot of tabs. Looks like they are viewing this from all perspectives. I assume under each tab it would be biased. You can join the mailing list, so they have articles coming out all the time. Daily Kos? I'm positive I haven't heard of them. Laura Clawson, never heard of her. it looks like it is citing its sources with the links imbedded. So this quote. who is Sauer? Is that Sauer? That person is quoted, 'Sauer and Others', I have no idea who those people are. I wouldn't consider this quote reliable at all, then. Maybe other quotes will be more reliable than this. So they are citing the Washington Post. The Washington Post got it from a primary source, so they are the secondary source. Do they even have a third type of source? I feel like quoting Washington post, who quoted a primary source, isn't very reliable, though it's okay. I don't know, it doesn't seem like I would use this if I was writing an essay. In fact, I think I would avoid it. Maybe if I were going to use it, I wouldn't use the actual article, but I think I would follow the sources. So one survey. I don't know, yeah, I would not use this, it is not very reliable. I would say a 3, because I would use their sources' sources.  Some research.  Okay, so Laura Clawson. It's asking me to sign a petition? Yeah, no, this just keeps getting worse. 3 plants to remove deep fat. Okay, no, uh uh, I don't like this at all. So Laura Clawson, who is she? She's been here since 2006. It doesn't really tell me who she is, she could be anyone. We don't know if she has any kind of degree, if she's written any books. Mojo? Yeah, no. I feel like this would go down even further, like a 1. Yeah, a 1.   Okay, I've also never heard of this website, but it's .org. So they're okay. no, it's staying at a 1. The site Washington Post and survey are good sources. The ads on the side. It asked me to sign a petition. There is no information on the author anywhere, even on the website. They cited their sources, sources.
