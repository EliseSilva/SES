NPR This looks like a news thing. Health news. They quote and actual professor of pediatrics so I guess that's good National Public Radio is what it is. I don't know, I feel like I'd give it, give it like a maybe a 6 because I don't know I feel like they have some good sources, but at the same time I feel like it's just a news station. Actually. National Public Radio is an American privately and publicly funded non-profit membership media organization. I feel like whoever funds it has some sort of say in what it says. I think I'll still give it like a 6. They source at least one good source (a professor of pediatrics). 'The people/organizations who fund it might have some say or bias. Okay, two minutes. This one I'm a bit more weary about because it looks more geared towards social media I guess. Looking at it I give it. but the contributor seems is the president and founder of Savannah College Art and Design. I feel like there's probably definitely some bias in there though. I give it. I don't know. Ok let's see. Huff Post. Yeah looks like it's kinda biased. It's a politically liberal American news website. So I feel like it's definitely gonna be biased. I feel like Huffington Post really isn't that reliable. I'll give it like a 4.5.  'Author is a president and founder of a college. 'HuffPost seems like a pretty biased source'  Adds 'towards liberal views and is just a company not an organization or anything'.  theBlaze Reads, study finds melting sea ice is actually helping Arctic animals. Well that title sounds a little bit false. Now let's see. So it's about a study by researchers at the University of Southern Denmark. Data by scientists at NASA who I think have a lot of evidence. Oh wait, but I don't think that says anything about what they're trying to make. It just talks about how they have less ice. I think this one looks more reliable because I feel like they have more sources than the other ones that they cite. It's an American multiplatform news and entertainment network. Television, radio and internet TheBlaze is the digital network that provides a platform for a new generation of authentic and unfiltered voices.It doesn't really say anything about the author which is kind of, I don't know. I can't tell if just like random people are able to post on this or what. It kinda looks like just anyone can post. Which is not to say that people can do a lot of research and post, but I feel like some people can just post whatever they want. 'It has a lot of evidence and sources to support their claims. 'I don't know much about the author and it looks like anyone can post to this site.'  The Washington Post. It's funny it doesn't say anything about the author either. And this is kinda her account of events. I mean it's not really opinion based, so it looks pretty unbiased. She's just kinda talking about what happened in the SpaceX.Well I guess maybe it has some opinions in it. I think it looks pretty reliable. The Washington Post I think feels pretty reliable. Let's see. Reads world national news, entertainment Reads the most widely circulated newspaper published in Washington D.C. Sounds like it has some, it's pretty reliable. 'It's the most widely circulated newspaper published in Washington D.C. and seems relatively unbiased.' 'It doesn't say anything about the author.' Daily Kos? This one looks more like a blog maybe. They quote Washington Post in here. That must mean that Washington Post was reliable.I don't know. It's hard to say. I feel like I'm not very good at this. Maybe like a 6.5. I don't know. Let's see. Daily K-O-S. Wow when I type that is one of the first things suggested searches is 'daily kos fake news'. Let's see.Reads is a group blog and internet forum focused on liberal American politics. A political encyclopedia. I don't even know what that means. From a liberal perspective. A group blog that seems kinda fishy.  I probably would not cite this in my work. 'It's a group blog and'  'only offers liberal perspectives, What make this more. 'Have other sources cites in the article.
