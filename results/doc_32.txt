starts first article NPR When they say we wrote about it and everything it sounds kind of informal. They don't really have very good language. Two paragraphs in a row start with but and again that's pretty informal. I'd say it's somewhat credible because it has scientists that are quoted. The language is still getting to me. It doesn't sound like somebody that is really very not a very intelligent person I guess. So I'll give it a 6. Well. Yeah, I'll give it a 6 Types in they quote the doctors that wrote about this law. the language they use is very informal and not educated. When he says I'm privileged to serve as president of a university that champions this third way it sounds like it's going to be a biased article. They don't really have very many facts to back up what they are trying to prove or. They are just stating observations it seems like. Continues to read silently (reads whole article) I like how it says in this last paragraph not long ago in the Harvard Business Review because it uses someone else's opinion to back up theirs. I would say it's. Let me see. Let me think.  I'd say it's a 3 because it's not totally wrong. He sounds like he has an opinion he looked into, but there are only a few other opinions that back up his, so it doesn't seem very reliable. He backs up his opinion with Steve Jobs and Michael D. King. It is mainly opinion-based, no fact to back up what he says. He uses other opinions, but that is still not as reliable as using facts. The title itself is kind of weird. Just starting with Global Warming Fail it just sounds like slang. I don't like how the very first paragraph is all one sentence. It's kind of confusing I like how it says a new study by researchers by the University of Southern Denmark because just it's not an opinion, it's more proved. I don't like how it says in that same sentence article animals are thriving as because of higher global temperatures. That just doesn't make sense. It's not even grammatically correct. I like how the first page brings it back to the researchers, and the press release. I am guessing that the press release is asking the researchers, but it doesn't really specify I don't think. I like how it says something from a professor at SDU too, so it's not just the University of Southern Denmark anymore. And NASA. It uses a graph. So I'd say it's actually pretty reliable because they have quite a few different sources.  I wouldn't' necessarily give it a 9 or a 10 though. They just made a lot of grammatical mistakes. I think I might be focusing too much on that. I'll give it like a 7.5 maybe. they use different multiple different resources to back up their claim. their grammar is not always great “ they use a lot of run-on sentences. The title itself is informal, but it is probably just to attract the readers. The title looks like a good title. It uses a video so I think that's a good thing. I like that it says the launch is 6:27 pm. They don't say like 6:30 or 6:25. It's very specific. It'll be a fact-based article. I don't sense any bias. It's not trying to prove a claim, it's just trying to give a fact. They are using facts but they aren't citing facts necessary. They aren't saying how they found those facts. It does quote people though. So that is a good thing.This is the most reliable one. Let me give it a 9. I wish that they just used more sources. More outside sources.  there is no bias, it is purely facts. They quote the people involved and state specific facts like 6.27 pm. I wish they had included where they got those facts, and maybe cited other outside sources, specifically other researchers that were not involved in the actual event.The title is informal but it's probably just to try to draw the readers in again. I like how it started out with a few facts in that paragraph. These surveys are good. Where it says Republicans are standing in the way of adequate funding it shows bias. I don't know if I would say it is necessarily reliable because it is putting their opinion. But it's not like they prove it with some facts. They prove it with opinions  but they don't show the counterargument too so I'm going to give it a 5. If I was to look at a resource on the opposing side I could probably make my own claim if that makes sense. the author uses facts in the beginning and quotes other people that have the same view as him.he does not show any positives from the counterargument, so it is very biased
