Right I'm supposed to be thinking out loud.  So I saw the article, just the screen shot  and it's NPR.  I personally trust NPR.  I've grown up listening to it, it's been a trusted source most of my life.  The news it presents is usually accurate, and holds up over time.  I've never had something that NPR taught me be disproven, per se.  And then, using internet, being asked to research it  I just googled 'NPR controversies' and like issues that they've had with misinformation, things like that.  And all that showed up was a lot of uh. It showed up on google search tons of articles by NPR about current credibility issues with everything else.  It talked about issues within NPR and issues outside of NPR, mostly the Trump administration so obviously I don't want to use NPR to find out if NPR is correct.  That's circular reasoning.  So I personally trust Wikipedia.  It's peer reviewed, it's edited by the public, but all information has to go through a fairly strict certification almost, like they just have to double check everything. And at the end of the day that's no more accurate than just turning to your neighbor and just asked what they know. But at least this one cites it's sources.  And I'm familiar with this site  Which talks about issues within Wikipedia, academic criticisms, and they try and locate resources in order to double check that Wikipedia is accurate and valid. And so for a lot of these things, Wikipedia tends to present a neutral perspective and factual events.  As much as facts exist.  They try and keep track of that.  So these are talking about issues with their internal affairs and things like that  This here tells me that consumers of information from NPR contend that NPR does its job well.  Which is nice to know, NPR thinks they're doing okay.  Okay University of Maryland says that people are more informed if they follow NPR and PBS, and NPR and PBS audiences had a more accurate understanding of the events in Iraq.  So it's like, so these things are good  I don't know how well they apply to this circumstance, and because I wasn't able to find a factual answer, I'm going to give a slightly lower grade of 8. Familiarity and I've never heard wide spread critiques of their credibilityI'm sure if you get involved more with NPR you can find critiques with this particular source, but I've never heard widespread critiques. The fact that I couldn't find a discussion about their credibilityIf nobody's checked it then I can't know, but if there's been a lot of checking it then I can feel a lot more comfortable.  I'm sure there are those discussions just within 30 seconds of researching I was not able to find them. Okay thinking out loud. So I'm gonna give it a 5, just based off the screenshots. Honestly if I'd seen this and I had just started reading it, I probably wouldn't have considered it, because I'm in the mindset of considering sources.  That makes me a little more nervous, simply because the author is the president and founder of Savannah College of Art and Design.  And I'm familiar with the idea that you ask somebody associated with the organization to write an article about it ummm let's see. What was that?  SCAD? What I see this as is just as a well-paid, well written ad.  I'm familiar with the concept of sponsored posts on social media and on blogs.  And so, it's not ridiculous to be concerned about that. Like if this group paid to write an article on Huff Post, then it's just a paid advertisement.  And it's hard to trust a design firm.  These are the people who it's likenever trust a brochure from an advertising company.  Cause those people are like, paid to sell things soit's just how it works. But yeahbI don't know where to begin researching this. We'll go back and just see what pops up. Percieved campus safety. I don't think my rating is gonna change, simply because it is a paid ad.  Where it seemsit feels paid to me. So what made it more reliable to me?  Huffpost is a familiar name.  I should look that up too Okay.  Their top stories are pretty crappy though.  Like this one right here  is like, focusing on feminism, and inequality in the work place, but then this one  is just promoting incredibly sexist ideas and this one is just in the news .  Not that big.  And again, Wikipedia.  Thank you again Wikipedia for being trustworthy. Yeah. So it just seems about as trustworthy as any other source that needs funding.  Huffpost is a familiar name.So again what makes it reliable is that it's familiar.  It's had a long-standing tradition of being respected.  What makes it less reliable is: Ad funding, and potentially unreported sponsored posts. Well crap. Okay. With a title like that, 'Global Warming Fail: Study finds melting sea ice is actually helping Arctic animals,' that makes me really concerned. 'While rising temperatures have certainly put a strain on species in some parts of the world,' and then it introduces what they want to talk about.  So it's acknowledging the fact there is evidence for humans harming wildlife with global warming, and they just want to talk about what supports their ideas.  Makes me nervous. No I'm going to keep reading the screenshot. Weird.  I'm going to give it a 3, due to personal biases. This right here, 'Recent data released by scientists at NASA reveals seas ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions are at their lowest recorded point since 1979, when satellite data first started estimating sea ice.' So we have no data before that, it's the lowest in history, which is short.  'Nearly 2 million sq km of Arctic sea ice are have been lost...' so 2 million out of  14.3 million.  That's concerning.  So we're accepting that ice is melting, and now we're just trying to like find positives on it.  Yeah nope, you're getting a 3.  What are you trying to say here, are you trying to tell us that it's okay?  Is it not okay?  A lot of people here  say that it's not. And again, we've got ads on the side.  Okay let's go to the Blaze.  Googles the blaze credibility issues. If Wikipedia doesn't show up I'm going to be hurt.  Oh, here we go.  'AllSides Media Bias Rating.' That sounds responsible.  Oh what was this!  Don't you touch Bill Nyethe bastards.  Oh founded by Glenn Beck Look at thatgood to know.  Not a man who I personally trust with science, or to present unbiased opinions.. 'Alternative to mainstream media outletsdistorting facts to fit rigid agendas' okaycool, big brother. Yeah, thank you.  'TheBlaze bias rating is Right.'  Okay.  Oh no.  'Progressivism is a diseaseit's a disease in America.'  Okay, so connections to Glenn Beck make me a little bit concerned.  I've not heard great things about him. Yeah, you're getting a 2.  Not much.  The fact that it mentions scientific evidence, and that it supports commonly reported beliefs that the ice is melting. The odd claim that melted ice and loss of habitat is good for animals.  It's connection to Glenn Beck who's more inflammatory than he is balanced.Like sure, short term good, possibly.  I'll allow that.  But it seems like a short-sided claim.  I don't know.  This one definitely needs to be more peer-reviewed, and I need to hear from a lot more sources that aren't just biased.  Yeah, good luck guys.  Washington Post  Elon Musk scares me, but for personal reasons. It's hard not to trust the left, when the left is committed to education and critical thought.  You know like, there are people who are out there to prove something. I'm just gonna give it a 7 without looking. Oh no, shite, that's the wrong thing. Don't report me to the honor code.  Thank you Wikipedia. Oh!  It's won 47 pulitzers.  Second-highestoh New York Times!  I'm from New York.  Respect. Nieman Fellowships, 368 Photographer awardsthey led the investigation into Watergateyeah so this is something that seems more committed to truth, or at least has a history of being committed to the truth.  The adsyep there's ads.  8? .  I'm gonna stick with 7.  Trust my gut. Okay and then after research, let's see.  Yeah I'll stick with a 7. A history of commitment to the truth (the Watergate scandal) and several awards.What makes it less reliable?  .  Controversies!  .  Ohoh no! Oh no. Oh baby, no we are gonna drop that down to a 5. Maybe not in the case of this article, but as a source that is concerning.  I just read about Amazon's Chief Executive being the owner of the post.  And that Amazon has 600 million dollar contract with the CIA.  That's a big ole conflict of interest.That is very concerning.  I'm still going to rate it higher than the blaze, simply because this article doesn't have anything to do with that I can see, that is concerning though, we'll give it a 4.  I'm getting less and less certain the more I think about it. Weird.  Weird weird weird. See this is the thing I'm scared of.  'Sarah Kaplan wrote an article' talking about someone being a 'fiercely anti-intellectual computer scientist for expressing doubt regarding climate change.'  I don't want to just shoot someone down for expressing doubt.  We need to have peer reviewed science, butit's been pretty proven so far, so it's tricky.  You want to support the truth, but you also want to play devil's advocate. Yeah, they've made mistakes, they're not perfect.  I mean nobody is. But that is a huge conflict of interest.  I'm still going to rate it higher simply just because this articlewell, dangit see I'm scaring myself now.  We'll leave it at the 4.  That's probably just political bias.  Sorry guys, I'm not perfect. 'There's a growing crisis in care' yup.  'It's a jobs crisis' yuuuuuup.  Daily Kos. Weird topics.  Those could be positive or negative.  Ads supported recommended lists.  Welp, there we go.  'Melania Trump thinks we're stupid.'  That's not a good sign. I like the action function that'syeah I'm gonna assume this is more even just based off this article title, this is definitely left.  But like, there is a growing crisis for care.  And it's a jobs crisis.  Like, welcome to the economy we live in.  As a social worker, this article's really reliableI should read it.  Dangit. 'one survey discovered,' okay good.  Ah.  Okay.  We're blaming Republicans for Medicaid issues.  I don't know if that's unfounded or not.  I haven't really looked into that. Yeah.  I have no reason to distrust the sources they brought up, or the facts that they bring into question. I have no reason.  Okay time to search. My biggest concern is about the validity of their points. Like yes, taking care is important but what's the best way to do it. Whoa!  They are super, super liberal.  Go them.  This is a bad day to tell you guys, but I wore my 'Resistance' band so like, awkward. Oh.  Yeah so this is more like, grassroots kind of thing.  I trust the grassroots though.  They're more involved, they're more ideological and less likely to get paid off, which is nice.  And they tend to be educated. Or manipulated.  Grrrr.  We'll give it a 4. The confirmation bias.  It states a fact I hold to be true, so why wouldn't I trust it?The left leaning diatribes, the grass roots credibility.
