I see that it's from NPR. That kind of gives me some credibility. I know that NPR operates from a national level, so it should be pretty accurate, pretty reliable. I know that NPR is also liberal-leaning, so when I see that it's on an article about something that is a hot topic, like birth control, I know that it can be kind of biased. So, I think I would put a 7. I would need to look at other sources as well to really have an opinion on that thing. So I see one from the US department of health and human services on adolescent development and contraceptive use. I might that's just from an initial search, I'm not going to read through the article, but I might you that article to fact check the NPR. Alright, let's see another one.  Alright . That's the claim I would put the credibility up a little bit after checking it against this databank, childtrends.org. This source seems reliable because it is an organization that operates on a national level. The fact that NPR seems to be generally biased towards a liberal ideology makes me question the reliability of this source and the information they give on a topic as politically charges as birth control usage.  I'm actually going to change this back, maybe back to 6, because I looked up birth control use harmful for teens, and I see there is also a lot of research from universities that say it is harmful for teens. So yeah, I would probably need to do more research on that, to not trust the NPR's opinion. Oooh. So my initial reaction, I see that it's from Huffington Post. I'm not too familiar with that source, but I know that they are also pretty popular, pretty biased or opinion-related. I don't know how much their stuff is based on science or just based on popular science or what people want to hear. Just from looking at the title, or just from seeing that, I would put its reliability at a 5, taking things at face value, no reading the article. So I can see, now that I'm reading the article, I can see that it is from the president and founder of a college, Savannah college of Art and Design, so that brings its reliability up a bit.  So I think, what I would do, to check the reliability of that source, I'm actually going to look up the president of that university, Paula Wallace.  So I can see that her in the article she is talking about a marriage or a unification of vocational and liberal education, and it seems like it's mostly her ideas. I can see later in the article that she references Harvard Business Review and Michael D. King. So it's probably a pretty reliable source, but when you look at her page, you can see that she is the president of the SCAD, it's an art and design university. So I imagine in a university setting like that, it would be pretty easy to marry, to put together liberal education and vocational preparation, because liberal seems to be towards the more artsy side than the vocational career side, so if you want a career in art, you're going to go to an art and design academy. So I'm going to leave the reliability at 7. 2nd rating at 7, as well. Just because I would like to see some other ideas from, maybe other types of university professors or presidents. More reliable: The fact that this article deals with a new way of looking at education and was written by someone who is very involved in the education process, the president of a university, makes it more reliable. The site Huffpost doesn't seem very reliable to me. I am not too familiar with the site. But it seems like it's kind of a popular site, not really interested in sharing grounded facts. So I also just looked up the main page of the Huffington Post, just to kind of see what the site was like. And yeah, that makes me keep the reliability of the source under 10, at 7, just because it seems like a pretty popular site. Not really interested in real science.  Seems like all of these sources are from news stations, and yeah, I don't trust news stations.  Well, I've heard a lot of evidence on the contrary (to the topic).  So, I would not trust this article, because I imagine it was written by somebody who maybe didn't understand the whole study, or only took the certain parts that supported his point. Now I'm just going to look up.  So, here's green peace international  Reads some of the very short article out loud. So it seems like it's helping some, but hurting a lot of others, so I'm going to leave that reliability pretty low. The article has some reliability because it cites a research study conducted by real scientists. This article is less reliable for me because it was written by someone who is not a professional in the particular topic. Also, they only cite one source to support their claim, while it is easy to find many other studies which refute that claim.Alright, so I see that this one is from the Washington Post, seems a little bit more reliable. And I see that it is not giving an opinion on a scientific issue, it's more like actually giving the news. Reads title out loud. I'm going to put the reliability pretty high. . Because, you know, it's not giving an opinion, it's just stating a fact. So I'll just fact check that, looking up So here is SpaceX, is actuallywoah.  Looks like they are a rocket company. And I see on their own website, they have the same article. So yeah, I'm going to leave that reliability a 10. This article is very reliable because it comes from a more professional source, the Washington Post. Also, it's reliable because it is a news article that talks about an event rather than a scientific issue. Newspaper can generally be trusted to reliably state the news.Well, I can't really think of anything that makes it less reliable. There's not really much to make me questions the reliability of the article. I might be skeptical of some of the predictions for consequences of the event the paper might make. Something that makes me always question the reliability of a source is ads. The ads that show up on the side. I don't know, when I see ads, I just think that the people who read these articles aren't being given exactly what the science says or what the facts are, but rather what they want to hear. Just the basic, maybe slightly-changed information, to be able to make a judgement call. But yeah, I usually don't think they have all the facts. Reads title aloud. So I believe that, so just from other things that I've heard, so I'll put the reliability at 8 to start off. I'm not familiar with the site Daily Kos. I can see that this actually cites surveys, it cites statistics on wages, cites the Washington Post I'm just going to look up Daily Kos.  Let's get that third opinion, or an outside opinion. So something that might leave the reliability up there, because they use a lot of sources. It seems like they have researched their topic well. But maybe a little lower, because it is a blog, according to Wikipedia. Or forum. The people who write these things are professionals or journalists or maybe they are. This source seems more reliable because it cites multiple other sources. This source seems slightly less reliable because it is from a blogging site and the person who wrote the article may not be a professional journalist or researcher.
