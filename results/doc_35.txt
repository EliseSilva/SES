All right so the first one says that over the counter birth control pills by shots healthy news from NPR. NPR is a relatively reliable site from my experience, they don't add too much additional stuff. So the sources they used look legit. They have NPR and yeah. I would take it to be exactly what it's saying. So I'd say it's pretty reliable. I'd say nine honestly. Well maybe eight. Sometimes they add a little extra stuff. It looks short. So I'm gonna look into what it's about. So I'm just kind of looking through some of these articles. There's one about Game of Thrones and disabilities. It seems like it's generally pretty free of polarized issues. They're talking about health issues and what we need to do to be more prepared. I would learn quite a bit from this place honestly. I'll still give them an eight. They're held a lot more accountable cause there's more people paying attention.Well for example I know their funding is being cut. From my experience they've had more of a liberal view on things, which is fine, like everyone tends to take a bias. I'd still say the source is reliable, but it is slightly biased. The articles by the president and founder of an arts college, all right. So there's no like official facts on here which I'm able to see. Most of these are opinions or quotes from one of their professors, which is still pretty reliable but it tends to have more an opinion-based quality on it. If I were to just take this, I probably wouldn't just straight up believe it. I'd give it a 6 just because I think it's believable, but if I actually cared about the issue I would've looked at a lot more sources to make sure I understood the issue correctly. I'm gonna look at the Huffington post. Or Paula Wallace. Cause I already know the Huffington post is pretty good as well. They're also pretty biased just in the opposite direction.I like using Wikipedia. It just gives you general information.That's interesting. She gets quite a bit of money from her job. So she obviously is really good at it, or she kind of sells herself out. But she gets a nonprofit compensation. That's kind of odd but good. The problem with art and design kind of things is that they're very based on belief, philosophy, that kind of thing so I won't take it as a super reliable thing that's based on facts. So I'll give it a 6. I actually have not heard of the Blaze. Let's see. Oh that's awesome. So this definitely is a polarization, they make their point early on. So I feel like it's really polarized, but it's interesting cause on the last couple of articles they had advertisements on the side that were actually helpful to the thing whereas this one has all this Trump, has the basic we're trying to fool you or we're trying to scam you stuff on the side. And, that really, it means they're kind of selling themselves out. So reliability, I'll give it a four. I'll give it a four. I'll check out the Blaze and see. Cause I don't actually know about the Blaze, I've never read it before. He searches the blaze and selects the first result, the link to the blaze's home page.Ooh, Authentic, Unfiltered, Fearless. Wow. First thing, The U.S. could have killed Kim Jong Un on July 4 “ and they made sure he knew it.Yeah this is definitely, this is definitely a hard right-wing group. I personally like Glenn Beck at times, but those things like Jewish writer explains why Linda Sarsour's 'jihad' against Trump is a threat. Things like that, Yes, Bernie Sanders, Americans are 'compassionate' “ here's the proof. So obviously they're against all left-wing candidates. But there's also like, All the celebsadvertising page, or just a lot of random advertising sitting around, like we couldn't get money the normal way, so we're trying to sell this site out. So I'd actually give it, I'd dock it to a four.More reliable to me? Well they actually provide the study. Sounds polarized, and a lot of knock-off ads. If you can't really get the big people to score. All right.All right, first glance it looks pretty reliable. They've got a video. There's lots of specific information. So I'll give it like a six without looking anything up.Let's see, it's by the switch, let's look up the switch. Okay so the first thing that comes up for the switch is a movie, so let's try. Next most popular one is an anti-trafficking agency. Oh, it's the Washington Post. Oops. So if it's something from the Washington Post (mumbling). I personally like the Washington Post cause they're pretty reliable, so I'll give them like a seven.Yeah they have strange analogies. Let's see this one. Daily Kos. Oh it's a blog. Lovely. Well it talks about.So I'm gonna give it a four. Let's look up Daily Kos. So the first thing that pops up is this pop-up that says Hey! It's being blocked! So it's like, Just kidding. We're trying to get excited about net neutrality. (Reads some more of the titles)Yeah this is a very hard left group. So I'm automatically like Great.Honestly, I would not pay that much attention to this.
