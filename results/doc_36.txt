So usually when trying to find whether a source is credible, I like to look up where it is from, and I like to look up the author.  And it looked like NPR is a reliable source because they are public and they are a media organization. It seems like this type of article is their specialty.  So it looks like Rebecca Hersher is a pretty well-known journalist on the NPR, and is very credible, because this is her job and she has also received the reward mentioned earlier in that website. It looks like it has credible sources inside of the text as well, which also is made me believe that it itself is a credible source.  And its sources also provide contact information, which I have been taught  is helpful for finding a credible source, because they are willing to take credibility. And it looks like it provides actual statistics ( I would rate this fairly high on the reliability scale.  So using the browser, I have decided that the credibility and reliability are high. And then, just from this screen shot, I would also put it a little bit lower, because I haven't had more proof “ but it does provide the author and provider of the article, whom I have heard of and know to be a reliable source. Author name. Reliable sources within the article. Facts (that can be backed up). Intelligent language in the article. Contact information. Published date (how outdated it may be).I actually forgot to check for the published date.  I think it was pretty recent. That means it is up to date, that usually helps me know how reliable it is based off of the time.  Unintelligent or extremely casual language (i.e. like, whatever, etc.). No name for the author. External sources seem unreliable as well. Article provider is questionable So when I say article provider is questionable, I mean, the actual source, kind of like the NPR. I know that is a little bit more reliable, because I've heard of it before, I've used it before, I've kind of researched it before. Versus providers of an article, like the Onion, that I know are not reliable, that I haven't heard of or seen, or that are small or unprofessional. This article seems fairly reliable to me, because I have heard of the Huffpost, I've used them, and it also has the name of the author, who seems to be the president and founder of Savannah College of Art and Design “ if I'm reading that correctly. I will research that, but if that's correct, that makes it fairly reliable. It was also updated fairly recently. And it looks like Paula Wallace has some credibility on the topic, since it's about universities and she obviously works at a university.  I would say that at first glance, this is about an 8 or a 9.  . Looks like she really is the president and founder of Savannah College of Art and Design, so that already makes it reliable. . Just glancing over the article, I didn't really see any external sources to research never mind, there is this one. It looks like he has a book, that helps his reliability, I think.  I don't know if this is the right Michael D. King It looks like this is not only the right Michael D. King, but that they are related articles. He looks reliable. I would still keep this at either a 9 or 10, just because at first glance it already seemed reliable, but then looking into it, it stayed that way.  More reliable: Author has experience in the field. Sources other reliable authors. Article source is well-known. Timely. So, a lot of times, the author will just be a journalist, but usually when the author is somebody who is experienced in this issue or in the field, that makes them more reliable to me because they obviously usually have an education on it that will help, or just that they are involved in it. Journalists are also reliable, but if the author is in that field, it makes it more so to me. The fact that she also mentioned Michael D. King, and that he was reliable, that helped reliability. So the Huffpost is pretty well-known, so that also helps. Not only is the article updated recently, but it looks like the issue she is talking about is pretty recent and that she has been involved in it for awhile. That also helps her reliability, which also helps the article's reliability. Lack of external sources and facts.So although this article got a high rate for reliability, is usually helps if they have links to other sources, like facts and statistics that can also be backed up. It's still reliable enough, but I think that usually helps. So this article I think I have heard of the Blaze, but that is not enough to make it reliable enough to me. But the author can be easily found, which is nice. It's also helpful that it has other, not only sources and facts, but sources and facts that are immediately reliable. . I guess I would give this, without looking anything up, another 8 or 9.  . So all of these sources that he has been involved in are really well-known and reliable, just right off the bat. Most of them at least, I don't know some of them. That makes him reliable. And then his sources.  I'm going to look them up.  So the people who did this study seem to have education regarding it “ well, high enough education that they are reliable regarding it. . And NASA is automatically reliable, if they correctly sourced them.  Looks like this source is reliable as well. So most of well, all the information that I've seen that they are acquiring to help with this article seems to be reliable, which then makes them reliable. So I would give this also a 9 or 10.  Most of them have been pretty high. The additional sources provided seem accurate and reliable. Many facts and statistics are provided. Author is creditablesic. The article was released/updated recently.Um, so with an article like this where it does seem very time-oriented, I usually find the source to be more reliable if it was recent, again like the others, but for this one it would be more important because global warming is something that is changing over the years, and more-recent studies would be very crucial to make this article accurate. The time is very important for all the articles so far, but with this one it makes it more reliable because it is so dependent on that.  Um this source wouldn't necessarily be less reliable to me for any reasons that I can find, except that I haven't really heard of The Blaze that often. I think I've heard of it before, but I wouldn't know enough about it, I'd have to research it more. But as far as the content reliability, I think it is reliable. But it's only reliable because all of the added sources, because that's what the article is, it's pulling sources from everywhere else. There's very few times where the author isn't just quoting another source or talking about what other sources have found. It would be helpful because then I would be able to go find these sources and I'd probably use them as my prime sources. But as I said, it doesn't really de-credit this article. But as far as the personal author, he doesn't seem credible on this issue, because he doesn't really talk a lot about it, he mostly quotes other people.  Too many quotes, not enough information from the actual author.But again, it doesn't really put a dent in the reliability of this article. So it doesn't make that big of a difference. And it's actually kind of helpful that it was mostly just a conglomeration of facts from other places. That was something that stood out to me. Just glancing at it already, the Washington Post is reliable. The author is provided. It looks like it says it was updated or posted on March 30, so that was pretty recently.  So it looks like this article is mainly about SpaceX, and down here it quotes SpaceX's president., so that is already reliable, when somebody closely related to the topic is quoted. And just glancing over the article, it looks like the author knows what they are talking about, and it is very intelligently worded, and that usually helps me believe that they are reliable. Which is sometimes bad, because if they word it intelligently, I automatically believe that. But in this case, there is other things to help support that as well. I would give this, again, another 8 or 9. So it looks like Christian Davenport is experienced in writing about this kind of topic, and that he is also reliable, and that he has been doing this for a while, so it also grants him more authority on the issue. I won't play it, but it's nice that there is a video provided, because that's just kind of video fact instead of just graphs and statistics, it is something we can observe ourselves, which is kind of nice. . Let's see if she is actually the president. I assume she is, but if I was trying to be thorough about trying to see whether the article was reliable or not I would probably research her.  It looks like she is. . It looks like he is, too. I feel I'm being repetitive, but this seemed like a 9 or 10 to me.  Quotes are from reliable sources who not only have experience and education in the field, but were involved in the specific subject of the article. Language is professional. Typically-reliable source (Washington Post). Author has experience in this specific writing field. So it's nice that Christian quoted people who are not only educated about this subject but were actually involved in it. It's nice when there's quotes from people who participated in what the article was actually about, then you have 1st-hand experience as well as educated experience. And it's also helpful that the author specifically writes about Space andwhat does it say?  It says military, but it also said space-related, I think. Nothing immediately stands out as ˜unreliable'. So automatically, I have never heard of this news reporting station place. It looks like the article was updated or posted recently. And there is the author that I can search. I also find an article more reliable when there are specific links to the sources, in the article. Because A. it makes it easier to test out their reliability, but it also shows that this author is more reliable, because they have provided sources that they used. And it looks like their quotes are from people who are also involved in this issue. I typically don't use this method, but I sometimes have: there are comments on this article that if I really wanted to I could read some of them. They are usually about the article, but sometimes somebody will comment saying whether it is fake or not. If I'm really interested in checking that out, it's nice that it is provided. Also, even though I haven't heard of this specific source, I have heard of the Washington Post, which is cited. So that's helpful. Based off of the fact that I haven't heard of the provider, I would maybe give it a little bit lower than the other ones, maybe a 7? It looks like she is a typical journalist, but I'm going to look up a little bit more about her.  Um, the fact that it is a group blog makes it seem a little less reliable, instead of an actual news station or website. And it focuses on liberal American politics, which can be helpful when it's focused on something like that, but sometimes when it's curated simply for the purpose of bias, sometimes I would find that unreliable. So she's not mentioned on here as wellsic. So it looks like she is a contributing editor, which makes her a little bit reliable, it seems like that is part of her profession. Due to lack of time, I won't search anymore, but because it's a blog, and because it is so biased, well, not so biased, but because it is created based off of bias, I would give this source either a 6 or 7. More reliable: Provides outside sources. Quotes authorities involved in the topic. Blog post site instead of news-oriented. Created on bias (liberal view site). Again, just bringing up the fact that it is mainly blogs instead of actual news articles. Just the fact that that's specifically what it normally covers, it would usually have a lot of bias, and you could probably find other articles that contradict it on a republican site, so if it is created with bias instead of just a neutral news agency, that kind of automatically lowers its reliability for me. So I would probably not use this source until I found a more reliable, unbiased source that agrees with it, then I could use this as a backup source. But right off the bat, I probably wouldn't use this one. I may read it, but I wouldn't cite it. But I might use it to find people to cite! In here she quotes John Sauer, and I might look him up, so it may be helpful, but I wouldn't use this as my prime source.
