No ads. Recent date. I'd say 9. It's a public heath article. Health News from the NPR. I'll look that up. NPR is National Public Radio. Seems reliable. Simple. Not too much going on picture, headline, links, quotes, reference to John Hopkins University. NPR (National Public Radio) -- seems reliable. References to John Hopkins. Quotes. Simple, clean, no ads. Headline, picture, article, included date and author. The Facebook, Twitter, Google Message make it seem less reliable, I guess referring to the sharing links on the side of the page. Twitter, google, and messaging on the side.Actually NPR doesn't seem that reliable. It is kind of vague, general. I don't know where it is from. No credibility with NPR that I can find. The article is based off of All Things Considered which is a side note to NPR. It doesn't seem very credible to me. This actually looks like something I would use. We could look at Huff Post. I actually use this a lot.Lots of ads makes it less reliable. Who is she? President of a College of Art and Design. Pretty credible.  Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter on the side make seem less credible. I guess the structure is what makes it look credible. Headline, picture, info. Contributor seems credible. Structure: headline, picture, article Harvard reference.Lots of ads. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc. on the side. Oh I like the Blaze. Don't like the ads. Don't like the pictures. Don't like Facebook or Twitter. Gonna look up The Blaze. Yeah, I'm familiar with the Blaze. I don't like the ads, but I like that relevant stories that they always have on there. Looking up Justin Haskins. He is an executive editor and research fellow at The Heartland Institute. Good enough for me.They reference a college and a professor, research. The Blaze always has relevant/timely articles. Reliable author. Recently written. Graph. Reference university research.Facebook, Twitter, too many ads.It's the Washington Post. That sounds great. It's clean not too many ads. I'd call it reliable off the bat.  They didn't provide the year that it was published. There are ads on the side. That is always a turn off. There is a cut off picture on the second page. What is The Switch? Are they talking about the movie? That's weird. Christina Davenport. Let's look her up. The actual name of the author is Christian Davenport. Oh, I looked it up wrong. Christian Davenport. He's a staff writer at the Washington Post. Reliable as an author. I'm looking up the article right now. Here it is. Yeah, the ads and Facebook and stuff on the sides are pretty annoying and distracting. I don't like when there are comments on the bottom of the page. But the Washington Post gives it lots of credibility. The Washington Post. Reliable author. Video.Does not provide the year it was published. Ads, but not too too many. Cut off picture on the second page. Comments on the bottom of the page.I don't recognize the Daily Kos. Lots of ads, Facebook, Twitter. The works, comments. I don't like comments. Alright, let's look at the Daily Kos.Oh. There's an immediate ad when I open it up. I don't like that. Hmm Hashtags across the top for the headings. I don't like that either. Lots of ads. Not much structure. Article inaudible and article.I guess I do like the big title. I don't know why. But the title itself is weird. Hmm I'd give it a 4. Big, bold title. Immediate ad after opening up the daily kos. No structure to the article. Hashtags on the side. Lots of ads. Oddly phrased title.
