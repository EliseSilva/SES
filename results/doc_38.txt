NPR  Ok I think that this article could be reliable, however I am kind of nervous seeing that it is NPR. I've heard that they can be more democratic. I may be wrong about that, but, usually all of the news websites they're going to be leaning towards one party or the other. So, usually it's good to look at sources from various news websites, you know. Ok. So, I thought I'd just look up here maybe on KSL like something about over-the-counter birth control. Um, and it's interesting it looks like they support it too. Just like npr does. Which is really interesting. And even looking at Fox News it seems like they support it so, I mean now that I've seen a couple other news websites  you know I trust in this source seeing that it is well known that birth control pills are being, you know, recommended  So that's  that's really interesting. I think it's a good source. Let's see, reliability  Let's see, I think I'll put it at 7. Just because, I mean, it's a good source but it's just I know that NPR can be very opinion based. I just don't see it as something super reliable. But, it's a great source. Uh the credibility, yeah, I guess that would probably be higher. Alright I think something I'll type in here The fact that the article quotes a professor of pediatrics.  pediatrics gives more credibility to what they're saying.It's less reliable just because I don't trust NPR very much. I think it would have been better if the source was directly from a medical website of some sort.The fact that the article quotes a professor of pediatrics gives more credibility to what they're saying.It's less reliable just because I don't trust NPR very much. I think it would have been better if the source was directly from a medical website of some sort. Huffpost Huffington post.  I find it interesting that the author of this article is the President and founder of this college of Art and Design. If she is writing this article I think her opinion might already be swayed towards that, you know promoting people to do art.  Uh, so I don't know how reliable I would find that. I think it would be better if maybe the author was somebody who is majoring like in education in general or teaching of some kind.  I guess since she is the president of a college, that's, that is a good. That adds some credibility.  Let's see.  Um, let me see here.  10:39Paula Wallace.  So I'm just going to look up Paula Wallace, just to see who that is.  Hmm. Yeah seems like most of what she has done is basically just art. I don't know it does say here that she authored a few children's books.  But yeah, I think with this source I would have to do some research and look up the subject on some other  websites to make sure that it's correct.  I think education is something that's very different depending on which news site you go to. It's not like science where it's more widely accepted, I think. There's a lot of different opinions out there about education. So,  I don't know I'll maybe put it as a 5. Maybe a 6. Um, let's see. The author is a  president of an art college.Being the president of an art college, her  article may be more swayed by opinion rather than fact.The author is a president of an art college.Being the president of an art college, her article may be more swayed by opinion rather than fact. Ok, so I guess just looking at it. Um, I'd give it maybe a five. But then maybe doing some research,  let me look up some more here. Um, what could I look up?  Um, this is another great article by the Huffington Post. Looks like talking about the same subject, preparing people for careers.  I guess a good thing, it was written in 2017. So it's a very up to date source, that's a very good thing.  Um,  I don't know, I'll put it  I think I'll just leave it as a 6. Um, yeah.  Theblaze Oh cool, theblaze, I've never even heard of this website actually.  Interesting.  Hmm, now because I'm pretty conservative I would find this source because I don't agree with global warming. So, it already does grab my attention. So, So this is saying that Global Warming is actually a good thing, which is kind of interesting, I mean  nobody really says that. Um, but I probably assume this is, this might just be a website that's republican, that's conservative. So, being how I am I would probably already consider it more reliable. Maybe like put like a 7.  Uh, let's see. It's pretty current,  2017.  That's good.  Written by Justin Haskins.  We'll look him up.  Hmm. Well if Justin Haskins is a fighter, I don't, is that right? Justin Haskins bio  let's see, writer bio. Here we go.  Let's see.  Okay, yeah he definitely looks like he's a more conservative writer. He was published in the Wall Street Journal. Uh, Fox News.  Uh, let's see. Yeah, he's director of the Republican party. So, even though I would find this article really good,  I don't know how good it would be for the general public seeing how heavily Republican it is. Seeing as Justin Haskins is the director  for the Rhode Island Republican Party.  So I, I'm thinking that  if you looked up this same subject on other websites it would probably be different. I mean, here, we can just look it up right now.  Global warming npr.  Yeah, I mean. Their saying that this air pollution is killing people. So, you know, that's a pretty different opinion. So I don't, I wouldn't put this as very reliable. Maybe a three.  I think a lot of people would disregard this source.  Um, so I don't know. Even though I'm Republican I don't know how well I would be swayed by this seeing as  lots of other scientists and people disagree with, would disagree with this article.  So, I mean, at first glance I'll put, you know, seeing that it is a conservative idea I would support, but yeah. Because this article is  conservative I would already look at it more positively. It's less reliable because a lot of other websites would disagree with this article. The writer is also the head of a republican part and not a scientist. Because this article is conservative I would already look at it more positively. It's less reliable because a lot of other websites would disagree with this article. The writer is also the head of a republican part and not a scientist. Yeah and seeing that he's not a scientist, the writer,  that also kind of worries me. I mean he does cite some research here I don't feel like the purpose here is to state facts I feel like it's going to be to convince people that Republicans are right. So, anyway.  Washington Post Washington Post, cool. Yeah I don't know this news, I mean I've heard of this news business before, but I've never really read them very much.  Ok. Hmm.  So it looks like this might be supporting NASA, in a way. Let's see. Ok, just looking at it I think it could be pretty reliable. Let's see, I guess I'm just kind of confused. I have no idea who Elon Musk is and a flight proven rocket.  Doesn't make a lot of sense because I think all rockets fly so I don't know, it's kind of weird. But sure, why not, I'll believe in this. I'll give it a 6. Um, but yeah. Let me see here.  Christian Davenport. I'll look up who that is. Ok.  Interesting.  So this says he's an author, works with politics, um.  Elon Musk. I'm going to look up who that is. Okay. Okay yeah I have seen this guy before.  So he's an engineer, inventor. Graduated from Stanford. Nice. Hmm. Umm. I don't know. I don't really have a reason not to trust in this article. I guess I can check out other news websites. Rockets. Wow.  Yeah it looks like Fox News talks about it.  CNBC. Yeah I'd, you know what I'll just give it a 10. Like I don't,  I can't think of anything really negative about it. 26:00 Let's see. Ok.  More reliable: Washington Post is a well known news website. I don't have a reason  not to trust the article.  Other websites talk about the same subject with what appear to be the same facts. Let's see. I guess the only thing that would make it less reliable is that it's a news website.  I mean that's more based on politics rather than science? I mean maybe looking up SpaceX on their website.  It looks like SpaceX has their own website.  That would be better. So, um. Being a news website makes this less reliable then perhaps spacex.com or some kind of science website. Washington Post is a well known news website. I don't have a reason not to trust the article. Other websites talk about the same subject with what appear to be the same facts. Being a news website makes this less reliable then perhaps spacex.com or some kind of science website. Daily Kos  Daily Kos. I've never heard of this website.  So, let's see.  There's a growing crisis in care for disabled and elderly people. Oh, and it's a job crisis, too. Um, I don't know, I think I would find this reliable just because I've read on Bureau of Labor and Statistics that that's very true. Care for disabled and elderly people is in high demand.  I'm going to look that up real quick.  Oh, dot gov. Uh, let's see.  Yeah. So here's personal care aides. I think that'd be about the same thing. Um.  Yeah they help people in their homes, people that are disabled, things like that. So yeah,  looks like there's gonna be 458,100 new jobs in the next ten years. There's 1.7 million jobs right now. So,  I mean,  the Bureau of Labor and Statistics  is pretty reliable when it comes to you know statistics about jobs. So, I mean I would already agree with this and probably put it at, I'd say 10.  Being pretty reliable. Just because of that.  I mean I had already known about that before.  Let's see. Uh, Laura Clawson.  I'll look her up.  The author.  Let's see.  Okay. Wow.  Um, what was I going to.  Laura Clawson. Ok. She has a PhD in Sociology. That's very related to what she's writing about. So, I'd say that's very reliable.  Yeah.  Let's see. It seems like these facts really match up. It says here there's a average of 10 dollars an hour that they earn. Bureau of Labor Statistics says about the same thing. $10.54 per hour is the median wage.  Let's see.  Wow.  I'd say that it's very good. So, yeah the statistics match up. The statistics match with what's stated  on bls.gov. The author has a PHD in sociology. Nothing that I can see. The statistics match with what's stated on bls.gov. The author has a PHD in sociology. Nothing that I can see. Very good source. Very good.
