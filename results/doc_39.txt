How would I rate this article's reliability? Initially, I have never really seen shots the news article or, oh NPR okay, I know that. There are some big words in there, obstetricians, gynecologists. It is very factual. They really back up their authority, ethos, so I think this is an 8 for reliability. That is initially what I think. So I guess I will just look up the facts they gave and see how accurate they areIt took me to this article, you can now get birth control from your pharmacist in California. 89.3 KPCC, never heard of this. So it is like over the counter birth control, which I have never used actually. So yeah, that is valid. Maybe I will look up Krishna Upadhya.  Yup, right, so that is a real person. John Hopkins University is really reliable. So yeah, I feel like the credibility off this source is good.  It is very objective I feel except it is pushing for birth control pills to be over the counter in all places. I am going to choose an 8 because I think it is a little biased. Not a totally objective point of view. So what makes this source more reliable? The use of outside sources.  It is kind of an opinion editorial or like a health thing,  but it is not using personal experiences of the writer rather it is using valid authority. If that makes sense. What makes this less reliable?  Let me think qualities that would make it less reliable would be, ummm, that is a good question, it's pretty reliable. Alright I just reread this. It is actually pretty objective. In Oregon's case, the law does not apply to people of all ages so, actually not everything is credible. Talks about what happened in the past and how, well, maybe the nation's leading group is not a statistic or anything that would back that up. Maybe that would make it less reliable. And there is no, what policy statement? Because I've never heard of this, but I am not very educated in this area. I guess it is pretty reliable.  So I guess qualities that would make this less reliable would be, the lack of nation's leading scientists. Okay, so I said that the qualities that would make this less reliable would be the lack of backing up the nation's leading scientists and the policy that came out nearly 5 years ago, because I haven't heard much about it. And everybody is probably more educated more than I am, but they do show a lot of credibility later on, so there is not much that makes this source less reliable. So actually I am going to , just because a 10 is just too good. The use of outside sources, not using personal experiences of the writer rather it's using valid authority. the lack of 'nations leading' scientists and the policy, cause I had never heard of it BUT they do show a high amount of credibility later on so, there isn't much. Okay  So this is Huff Post, never heard of them either so. Wow, so the writer is President and Founder of Savannah College of Art and Design, that is pretty reliable I think, ethos. This is kind of hard to read Okay so it is talking about opinions and beliefs and not respecting other peoples or listening to others. Seemingly endless debate higher education. I don't know if I agree with that. Vocational preparation verses liberal education. Who's to say? That's a good question. Okay, a little ethos in there, he says, I am privileged to serve as President of a University that champions a third way. So I guess he is establishing his credibility, there are two ways, but actually I am the President of a University that does it a third way. Which is not really factual, but sure it boosts your credibility. Okay, this is just boastful.  Okay, this is a pretty cool guy establishing what he has done, sure. I think that is valid Okay, I think this is like a 7 on reliability, umm, and types in vocational prepar and click on option that pops up saying vocational preparatory instruction then adds to the end of that search vs. liberal education.Okay, I am going to look up vocational preparation verses liberal education.  Okay, so I am going to look inside Higher Educationit is another article. This article there is more than one point of view there are references to other people, like kids in college or Pablo Silva, a history professor, it's less of one perspective and there is more credibility established in this article than the other one  because this one is just one person that likes to talk about himself. I'd give it like a 7. Overall,  yeah a seven, because this is a real issue but it's from what I've read in the screenshot it has been untested. Well it says that we've been a success but what do you mean by success, I wish he would establish more like '90% of our students have gone to be amazing people', you know, if that makes sense. Obviously I can't see the whole article here, but it is interesting and a valid topic and he also has credibility for being the president of this college. So what makes this more credible?  The authority of the author being the president of the college and having experience in that area. The lack of statistics and other points of view made also, he didn't make it a valid enough problem today I think Because I think, in my opinion higher education is either way, vocational preparation or liberal education it is supposed to teach a higher way of thinking, more critical thinking, more questioning.  So he didn't really present this as a problem really. He didn't really create a problem, so it wasn't as important. That doesn't make it less reliable, I guess, so that is not really important I guess. The authority of the author, being the president of a college, and having experience in that area made the source more reliable to me. The lack of statistics and other points of view made the source less reliable to me, also he didn't really create the problem so it wasn't as important. Meditation! Oh, that's not what it is talking about. The Blaze. this is interesting. Alright, so University of Southern Denmark, cool. There is a quote in there, and there is even a data chart!  Okay, so I am going to rate this as a 10,  huh, , it's not perfect. Now I guess I can look up USD,  USD arctic or global warming study I guess I should put University of Southern Denmark, not USD. Oh, it's called SDU.  Alright, yeah, this backs up everything that they talked about. Okay, sweet Over all what made it reliable, it seemed like the writer wasn't really there at all. I don't know what the rhetorical thing that is called, but it seemed like the writer wasn't there at all, but his facts were presented. There was a graph as well as multiple resources used to back up the claim provided. Maybe this source had a wider audience, because I fit in that audience better than the birth control one, it was more reliable to me, because it is something I'm more interested in, if that makes sense. What made this source less reliable? Not much. Well when he says, rising temperatures have certainly put a strain on species in some parts of the world okay, never mind, that is nothing. Yeah, not much. I am just going to put that. Nothing, nothing at all made this source less reliable. It seemed that the writer wasn't there at all, the facts were all substantial and interesting, there was a graph, as well as multiple resources used to back up the claim provided. They are setting the scene, soaring tower of thrust and power ooo that rhymes. So it's a rocket that can take off and also land, am I reading this right? meant to serve a higher purposeHmmm, yeah, I agree with that, it's a waste, also pollutes and littering the earth, We're not a one-way-trip-to-Mars people It's cool, yeah, it's cool. So I think this is like an 8  I think mostly because  there are a lot of, oh I need to research it huh? Umm, Space X. Spacex.com,  reusability, world's first reflight. Wow, that's awesome! What qualities or attributes? I think in this case the personal experience  offered in the first paragraph makes this source. I don't know why it is just in this one. It is like one of those first hand stories, 'I was there, I saw It describes what it looks like, does that establish more credibility? I think so. So, the first few paragraphs make the source more reliable, rather than opinion. I think it is more reliable, the first few paragraphs, the fun situation, citing the scene like he does, it's a firsthand story rather than an opinion should be this or this.  Also the use of the sources,  such as Gwynneth Shotwell, Falcon 9. I think what makes it less credible Ummm, I don't know. I think it is pretty credible. It also brings it down to the level of the audience that is reading/needed. So that makes it more reliable. So, nothing, sorry if that is not helpful, I'm just going to put that in the less reliable. The personal experience offered in the first few paragraphs makes the source more reliable. It's like a 1st hand story rather than an opinion, also the use of the original sources. Nothing Article. Oh on the last one, anyway. Yeah, actually I know about this. It is really hard to be a nurse assistant or hos. what are they called? Oh, hospice. Oh, that's sad. I think they do a really good job.  Because of a personal story. First to begin with, there are facts and statistics that back up the claim. The personal story is, makes the source more reliable. I think what makes it less reliable I'm trying to think if the pathos used makes the source more reliable or less reliable? I think it is more.  It taps into the heart strings of every person that reads it, hopefully. The claim is that increased funding would help protect people's health So I think what makes it less reliable is that there is not a specific  It claims there is an easy solution but the solution the article presents is not backed up and not guaranteed.  Okay, so I think what makes it less reliable is that they say if we would just increase funding then we could protect people's health and it would create good jobs which would lead seeing people in their homes than moving into nursing homes. So that personal jab hits republicans. Huh, I think it should maybe present a counter argument like, this money should go to this right now, but it would be better. I don't know. It's not like we don't want what the money is going to at the current moment, I don't know what it is going to or why it was decreased but it's definitely a little more emotion than credibility if that makes sense. There are facts, and statistics that back up the claim. The personal story makes the source more reliable because it taps into the heart strings of every person who reads it. It claims there's an easy solution, but the solution the article presents is not backed up with a lot of evidence and not guaranteed to succeed. More emotion/pathos than credibility/ethos
