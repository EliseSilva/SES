Over-the-counter birth control pills would be safe for teens, researchers say. I like how it says a date. Especially since it is very recent.  Pictures are always nice. Birth control pills actually may be safer for teenagers than for older women, a study finds. It says authors, I wish it would tell me more about them though. But so far it seems pretty reliable.There is a growing body of evidence that the safety risks are low and benefits are large. Oh, there it is. Krishna Upad, oh wow. Assistant professor at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine and the lead author of the review which was published this week in the Journal of Adolescent Health. Ok, that paragraph was very awesome, boosted my confidence in this reliability.  In fact, she says, some of the potential negative side effects of oral contraception are less likely in younger people. For example, birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progestin come with an increased risk of a type of blood clot called a venous thromboembolism, but that risk is lower in teenagers than in older women. As a result, the pill is potentially safer the younger you are. Hm, that's neat. I also like numbers.  Teen pregnancy rates are way down in the U.S., and teenagers are using contraceptives more often. Between 2007 and 2013, the number of 15 to 19-year-olds giving birth dropped 36 percent. The abortion rate has also fallen. Yeah, I guess I would rather have contraceptives than abortion. I wish they wouldn't do it anyways. But anyways,  these pills are safe and effective and we should reduce barriers to using them and teens should benefit just as adult women do. Um, k, seems pretty legit. It has another person, Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., introduced a bill in 2015 that would automatically amend the language of the ACA to require insurance companies to pay for any contraceptive approved for over-the-counter sale by the FDA. Um, ok  it has a lot of things that were reported to the ACA. ACA, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I really like that. There's a lot of facts I feel like a statement issued in February. A lot of dates, not too many numbers, but still numbers. FDA, FDA. Ok and this site is .org, I also like that. I think this is a very reliable, I would say like a 9. It's pretty, pretty high but ok. Oh man, ok. So, I'm going to research the senators because I feel like they'd have information on them.  Introduced a bill. K, it actually had a link that directed me directly there. I'll see if it actually is something. In 2015, in 2015.  The numbers match up. That's really nice. Dot senate dot gov, the website address seems very legit as well. I believe strongly that women should be able to get the comprehensive health care they need. And that was Senator Murray's remarks, so it actually has real things in it.  I wonder what a permalink, I don't know what that is Oh, it directed me back to the top, that's nice. K so,  Senator Patty Murray, that is legit.  And this other person,  directed me to another bill. So,  they're not lying, at least about the senators. Um,  Um, it even says allowing greater access to safe and effective contraception act. K, so  both of these senators do say these things. Um  I like that it has a lot of links. Whenever I click on them it does show me exactly what it wants me to see.  And it does line up. OTC  Yeah ACOG supports over the counter (OTC) access to oral contraception, without the need for a physician's or a pharmacist's prescription.  K, as we have reported  Oh,  it took me to an earlier article. Wait, was it earlier? I don't remember. Here's What GOP Bill Would (And Wouldn't) Change For Women's Health Care. And so, abortion coverage, planned parenthood funding. What wouldn't change.  Republicans have stressed that this bill was just one of three parts, so it's hard to say definitively what wouldn't change at all as a result of their plan. But thus far, here's what is holding steady Maternity and contraceptive coverage.  So that's, not changing.  The end of gender rating.  Um  The current Republican proposal to repeal part of the ACA would not affect mandatory coverage. That's exactly what they've reported.  At least the links that they are sending me to  are all checking out so far  Abortion rate falls to lowest level since Roe v. Wade. That's, I like that. I'm just going to say right now, I like that.  Ok, and then it has more information and more links. So, there's a lot of information.  Um, even under the service of this article. So,  requires  Ok. Pregnancy rates takes me to took me to a graph before it and here it tells me about pregnancy rates where there's more numbers and more facts to be backed up. Um, I'm just trying to click on something. And it takes me to pretty legit websites that have .gov or .senate .gov So, so far I am really thinking that this is pretty, pretty reliable. K, so I searched it.  Again, please explain your thought process, ok. Um, I might even put this as a 10  But I am kind of still skeptical about anything on the internet. The links that were provided in the article all checked out. The links took me to cites that ended in things like .gov and .senate.gov, which to me, seems very reliable. The article itself had .org, which is not too bad. The numbers and facts provided helped, especially since they were backed up by the links, which also seemed credible.Yeah. Less reliable, ahh, oh no. Less reliable: The ending of .org is not the absolute best indicator, but still is not bad. Other than that,I'm not actually sure, um what would be less reliable, let's see. I want to go back,  More stories from NPR, popular on npr.org, K, subscribe, shots, k  their sponsors, no its just one sponsor, their sponsor is novo nordisk There's nothing like tampons or something, I don't know, with that I'd be a little hesitant. But there seems, pretty good, pretty good. Reporting things  it wants me to subscribe, that's usual.  So it seems like it's like an article, so of course they would want that. Julie Rovner.  Even takes me to stuff about her.  Oh well that's neat, okay.  I'm pretty  I like the site. Other than that, not much stands out. I do not recognize the cite as a common one, so that might make it less reliable to me.The links that were provided in the article all checked out.

Other than that, not much stands out. I do not recognize the cite as a common one, so that might make it less reliable to me.Ok, next! Second article: Huffpost. Oh, I took a lot longer than that.  Ok, so it's the same thing again  A Third Way for Universities  K, third way Huffpost, I've heard about that. So, that's good, again I like the date  updated, it's better to be updated than not. Ok, that's good  Ok, ads are just ads though, I mean, you can't really get away from that but  Generation Z are calling for career-specific education. On the other hand, cultural icons and thinkers, from the late Steve Jobs to CNN's Fareed Zakaria, have insisted that the way forward is through classical liberal learning, where students consider the most enduring questions of the human condition through the study of literature, the arts, and the social sciences. Ooh! K, it has a link.  I like it,  Scad Alumni Employment Study Ok!  Key findings, Ok  I guess more numbers. This is a good paragraph,  When I helped create the, it does have I  So I feel like that's um, I mean it backs it up with opinion, with facts but opinions, I don't know it sounds more like opinion, opinionated, which isn't the absolute best but  Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) in 1978, I saw that most art and design colleges simply ignored the question of careers. In art college catalogs of the day, one hardly found mention of career services, and so I set out to change that. Nearly 40 years and tens of thousands of gainfully employed alumni later, I'm happy to say that we've been a success.  K, that's what where the scad comes in, ok. Marrying the sublime and the practical into one unified, balanced learning experience isn't easy, nor is it unique to specialized institutions such as ours. Ok.So first we need to  ok. That's neat, Third way for universities. Ok and she wants art and design colleges.  Ok so, gotcha, gotcha.  First, universities must adapt, Second, universities should marry the intellectual and the practical in the same classroom. Yeah because you want a job after college. That makes sense ok,  it has more links, I like the links  and that's .org  Um, bombarding alumni  Washington Post.  Took me to another.  universities are bombarding alumni with ask after ask, and that took me to the Washington Post. Um, just another article that backs up theirs I guess. Ok.  Ok, so I think that's been two minutes. Um, I would put this as  a 7?  I don't know, I don't know. Seems pretty good, but  it almost is like an opinion editorial, which you can only take so much with that.  I'll put that as like a middle, middle 7,   cuz I guess I kind of already did that  I should have done that later. But, um all the links check out. Um  K, um, oh I do not like Here's why these guys, sponsored links by Taboola Ok these other articles don't seem credible at all. Here's Why Guys Are Obsessed With This Underwear? Yeah I  Brilliant Kids That Will Make You Feel Like an Idiot, ok  I don't like this one as much as the other one. I put like a 6? Cuz I mean it still had facts but, blech, okMore reliable: Again, the links made it appear very reliable, taking me to good cites that said what the article said they said. Said what they said? Wait. That said what the article said they said? Yeah, that makes complete sense Yeah, this one ends in .com.  Ok, source more reliable. Also,  providing the date it was published and a date that it was updated helps their case.Ok, less reliable. You know what, I think I'm actually going to move this one a little more. Ok, less reliable to you. Um Less Reliable: At first, it seemed pretty reliable. But when it started saying I's, me's, and my's kind of thing, it sounded more like an opinion, even though it was backed by some evidence. The biggest hitOk wait a minute,  Furthermore, I do not find .com cites very reliable in general. The biggest hit, though, was  the other articles or sponsored things at the bottom. One was about why men wear that kind of underwear. That  really takes away credibility in my mind.More reliable:Again, the links made it appear very reliable, taking me to good cites that said what the article said they said.

Cuz then it would make mine seem less reliable, so that would be bad. TheblazeK,  third one!  Global Warming Fail! Study finds melting sea ice is actually helping arctic animals. Whaaaaaat. Ok.  Ok I forgot the title  Ok, I'm just going to see if that goes to it  TheBlaze.  Yup, k, so take a couple minutes, first impression. I like that it has the time again. The author. Oh, I forgot about checking the author. I don't know if the last one had an author, that's not good, but oh well, I didn't like it anyways.  Um, so it has links again,  I like that. Numbers, numbers are good  Ooh, I like this interactive graph.  That helps its case. Um,  .com again, I mean they're not the worst, but again, oh my gosh  eeww, ah goodness.  It shows a really big snake. Alright, but again it like, recommended from the web, it has the same Here's why guys are obsessed with this underwear!  And oh my goodness, oh, it has comments. Ok, there's lots of comments. So I mean I guess it's like, you have to be picky and then you might have to read the comments. Like 5 notable global weather fails: 1) Global cooling, I mean Global warming 2) There will be seven billion people on Earth by the year 2000, the Earth. Oh, wait a minute  how far away  2017,  I don't know.  K, first impression though , it's pretty good. I like the interactive graph a lot. Um, yeah  So I'll put it at like a 6  Cuz last time  last time it didn't have  very good, yeah, I don't know  But I do, this graph is really nice.  That makes me happy. Ok, um Takes me to another .com, but its USA today.  That's, that has a reputation  Looks like it is taking a lot from USA Today, not like a lot a lot, but, let's see, ok. The link to a new study  Watts up with that .com that doesn't seem very convincing. Watts up with that. It's another .com,  Inconvenient finding: Melting sea ice may lead to more life in the sea. I'm k, let's see Global warming fail, surprising benefit, hmm melting ice may lead to more life in the sea, all of these are .com.  Oh, there's a .co.uk  Arctic Climate Change, how will animals be affected, sea life changes as a result of melting ice caps, digital journal  ooh! Warming seas, melting ice sheets, NASA, let's see  Nasa.gov, I feel like I would. K.  sea level rise is a natural consequence of the warming of our planet. We know this from basic physics. When water heats up, it expands. So when the ocean warms, sea level rises. When ice is exposed to heat, it melts. And when ice, ok. This rise is accelerating? That doesn't seem very good.  While NASA and other agencies continue to monitor the warming of the ocean and changes to the planet's land masses, the biggest concern is what will happen to the ancient ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica, which continue to send out alerts that a warming planet is affecting their stability. Ok so,  the article, that I'm testing their liability  was like yeahh! Ice melting is good! That it's good, that it's good for the life. I don't know though, might be good for the sea life but might be bad for the other life.  Um, The Warming North,  Changes at the Southern End of the World,  Ok  it didn't really say anything about the life though  Melting ice and glaciers! Arctic ice is melting, and sea animals can now move to a  to a different ocean. What?  You would never expect to see a zebra in Canada, or a kangaroo in Japan. That would be pretty surprising. That is how scientists felt when they saw a gray whale in the Mediterranean Sea in 2010. Grey whales normally live in the Pacific Ocean. What was one doing so far from home?  Ok, I need to sign in for the rest of that so I don't like it. Ugh, well ok. I don't find it very reliable.  I think I'll go down to  what was I at?  Was I at a 6? Yeah I was at a 6  So bringing it down to a 5. K, more reliable. More reliable: The author's name and date. Publishment? it was published make this source more reliable to me. Also, I really liked the interactive graph. That made it seem  like it worked hard to find the facts. Again, the links were good, but not as good, since they were all basically .com.K, less reliable. Less reliable: Again, the underwear ad was not impressive. The big claim it was making  made me feel on edge about the information. It was like it was saying that global cooling or warming or whatever could be good, while NASA disagrees.So that was bad, I'm just going to move on.

The Washington Post Ok,  Elon Musk's SpaceX makes history by launching a ˜flight-proven' rocket. Oh man.  Elon Musk's  SpaceX  K, let's see if that Ok, .com, but it's Washington post. So, March 30th  it doesn't have a year but I'm guessing it's this year. Christian Davenport is the author.  Um, it includes a video. That's reliable. I like that.  La la la, k it has numbers as facts.  than the 3-2-1, bone rattling liftoffs of fire and smoke that have reignited interest in space exploration. So it looks like it has all of the rhetorical devices. Um, so they would have to be a pretty good writer,  hopefully they are using it responsibly. As I have learning in my writing 150. Um SpaceX president, they have a quote from her. Ok, and they have a former NASA executive chairman. That's nice.  That's neat.  And they have 42 comments.  K, and then it takes me to more posts and everything and then paid promoted stories.  It's time to say goodbye to solar? Here's what new dental implants, why doctors in the know no longer prescribe Metformin, ok this is nice. Auto Repair scams, ok.  But that's ok, they're paid.  K  Democracy dies in darkness. Democracy dies in darkness, it's still the Washington post though right? I think it is. Hopefully.  That would suck if it wasn't. The Switch  I'm confused. I'll put it at like a 7.  K, I'm going to see if it's actually Washington Post!  Washington Post.  Breaking news!  Democracy dies in darkness, ok, so that's still a thing. And then  Yeah, I wonder why it says that but I mean that's pretty cool  So it looks like it's still, it's actually the Washington Post. Don't know why it says, ok, neat. So, that is good.  I'll look up SpaceX next.  SpaceX. Define.   Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, better known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. Ok I'm pretty sure it actually mentioned Hawthorne, so that's good. That's pretty cool.  I do like the video. I could play video. I'll play it a little bit.  Fast forward.  hahahaha okay.  Computing power, okay.  Seems pretty good. I like it!  I'm going to move it up to an 8.  Ok. More reliable: This seems reliable due to the mentioning of the author, date it was published,  the video that was included, and the fact that it was a Washington Post article. I think that familiarity is good since this journal is well known. Ok, less reliable.Less reliable: It did not have the links the others did. Um,   Scruffy and scorched.  The tone was less  I spelled that wrong.  The tone was less professional. Why does it, I spelled it right. Ok.

I already forgot.  in care for disabled people, oh goodness. Ok, here we go. Daily Kos. Never heard of it.  Skip action. Oh my goodness, there's like a game up top. I don't even know. Dot com.  39:01Has links though.  Being a home health aide or nursing assistant is a physically grueling job with low wages-an average of $10.11 an, yeah. The economy has improved, it's harder, it's become harder to fill those jobs. People who would have taken them in 2009 or 2010 can now get better jobs. But it leaves a lot of very necessary jobs unfilled, and the problem is likely to get worse over time.  This, I actually have experience with. I took a CNA class and my friends afterwards, they were in some good jobs super easily. Cuz they just, they need CNAs. So, already, since I agree, I'm probably am more inclined to think it is more reliable. It has links. Dot org!  K, that one led me to a .org. Dot org.  It mentions Washington Post.  K. So, first off  I say it's a  7. I didn't like the game up top. That was weird.  K, now I'm going to  I probably should have searched that sooner.  I find it so, I've been reading the Post for the better part of 50 years-a bit more actually-and I've been a journalist in the Washington area for about 40 years. Ok, yeah, I think it's reliable. K, it said it has numbers. Things are backed up, one survey discovered.  And it takes me to the actual survey. And that's where the .org came in.  Long term care The fact that I know this is true also helps.  Then again it does the author and date.  K, becomes harder to fill those jobs  Oh it does take me to the Washington post!  I like it, I'm liking the Washington post here.  Um, and it has quotes  from others. I feel like it's almost like half quotes, which isn't the worst. 41:24 Caregivers don't show up or shifts are cut back or canceled, I don't get proper cleaning around my catheter or in my groin area. Oh, that actually goes straight to the elderly.  Oh man.  The words ˜unprecedented' and ˜desperate' come to mind, said, ok. Ok. I'm going to leave it at  Is it .com?  Oh it is .com and I've never heard of the Daily Kos. But I mean, 7 is better than nothing. K more reliable. k  The author's name, and date it was published,  providing  information from the Washington Post, having a quote from an actual resident, and the fact that I find this true and the fact that I actually know it's true since  I'm CNA certified all make it seem reliable to me.Maybe I should like bump it up a bit  Like a 7.5.K less reliable.
