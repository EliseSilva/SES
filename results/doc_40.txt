Reads the instructions out loud beginning with please take two. It starts, has some information on the top, looks like a news article kuer 90.1 has a photo, that is generally a good thing. Shows options for google+, twitter, facebook, email. It is really nice that the author is at the top in a box, although they do not have any information about her which is kind of strange. It has the date and the time, that is good. It is heard on All Things Considered and it has a tab where you can click on that, so it has sources which is always reliable, well not always, but sometimes Okay I guess I will just lead it out loud It is good that they put two examples. I would like for them to put who the author actually is; I know they put a hyperlink (review of oral contraceptive research) but it is nice to put an author right there.  Okay, that is good, they stablished her ethos (referring to Krishna Upadhya) Okay, it is a news station, public health. I think it is pretty reliable. Somewhere around 9 and 10. Okay, that is cool, so I can look up Krishna Upadhya. So I am looking her up right now and Boom, right on the side of google it gives me feedback. It says that she is a Pediatrician in Baltimore, Maryland. And she is also in Hopkinsmedicine.org Faculty directory for Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Public Health. And she has a professional profile on Linkedin. I do not feel the need to actual click on any of the sources because there are organizations and edu's, and a Linkedin all right there, so she is probably a reliable person. But, I would like to see California authorized pharmasists to distribute most types of hormonal birth control So I will look up California hormonal birth control. Okay, so it looks like Title 16 is what it looks like, according to pharmacy.ca.gov. So it is from California state board of Pharmacy. It is a .gov, so I generally trust those. It says, This protocol has been adopted as Title 16 California Code of Regulations section 1746. And they were wanting to say that to distribute most forms of hormonal birth control. So it looks like you can do a screening, and oh wow, there is English, Korean, Russian, Spanish so they do, and so on, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Traditional ChineseI think one of the site showed, self-administered oh yeah, that one, self-administered protocol. So you can self-administer it. And then I will look up the same thing in Oregon (searches Oregon hormonal birth control) Oregon.gov/pharmacy. Going to that right now. Skims through the pageI am going to try and search in their search program on their website for hormonal birth control because I am not seeing it show up. It has a bunch of results but the first result says Oregon pharmacist to prescribe and dispense hormonal contraceptive patches and self-administered oral hormonal contraceptives. Okay, so overall, I know I didn't look into the book. But I have enough information that I can trust it more now. I will give it about a 10. Overall, this site uses outside sources, which are reliable. Government organizations and professional are used to further derive Hersher's point. She also speaks with a formal voice and her site looks professional. That Oregon site didn't look professional it looked like Google from 1998 er something. That is always unwelcoming as a whole and they tend to drive you away, but it was a .gov so I ended up trusting it. No information about the author is provided besides her nameWhich deters from who they are. Actually I am going to look up Rebecca Hersher really quick too. So I am searching rebecca hersher So it was NPR, there was a little thing that said NPR at the top My questions wasshe might be from Harvard Gazettethis just says NPR journalist. So it looks like she has written a lot. I would like to see her credibility though. So I am on the NPR website, but I am not seeing a bio for her, which is kind of lame. No information about the author is provided besides her name. Even when going onto the NPR website, no information is easily accessible about who she is. Okay, now moving on. Thinking out loud still by the way. Same thing as before Paula Wallace, contributor, President and founder of the Savannah College of Art and Design. Okay, cool, so it says who she is but my question is, College Art and Design, hopefully that has something to do with the article. Having adds is really annoying. But generally if you have ads they want to pay to go on your thong because people are watching it. So while I find it annoying it also says, hey this generally is a well visited site which if it is the huff post, which I imagine is the Huffington Post, they are going to have opinions that generally the public trusts.And once again they have facebook, Twitter, Pinterest this time, mail, and then a little chat thing. So it looks like there is a way to contact them. They have one on the top too, so I wonder if that is her thing and then Huffington has its own individual one too. Subscribe to Follow. It doesn't say ad, the other one is an ad, I wonder what this one is? Okay, I like the parallelism there. Do they have studies for that? I hope they go further into that (referring to the 2nd paragraph and its statement about the way forward. Okay, now she is going to go into why she's talking I guess, like her importance in this situation, her credibility.  I imagine that success it could be a link, so I could go to that and see where that leads us to. I always like when people number things, it is very easy to follow and it keeps the reader engaged. do themselves a credit that sounds weak After reading that, I have a bias against parenthesis, that is generally an informal way to go about things, and that draws away from and I am like, okay, I don't trust this source as much anymore. But it is the Huffington Post, so they have a name established so it isn't as big of a deal, but it is frustrating. Curricula, that is fancy . Okay, cool, they use Harvard Business Review, everybody is talking about Harvard because that is a prestigious place. Who is Michael D. King? So they say Harvard and then they just throw a random name out? It makes me think this is a business review, is this a teacher, a professor there? Is it just a review thing where it is like an Op Ed or something? I want to know who Michael D. King is. Okay so I am going to rate that  I have probably been taking too much tie on these haven't I? I am just going to look up Michael D. King really quick on Google. I do like how they provide information about the girl  I clicked on a link for Michael D King here. Hmmm  I want to know who he is though. This is the same thing as NPR it is not really providing easily accessible or to find stuff. I am going to check at the very bottom of this. Okay, he is the vice President of. Good enough, I can move on. What did I rank them up above? The already credible author uses another professional Michael D King. to further drive her point. What makes this less reliable the parenthesis. Using parenthesis in a professional journal deters from the piece as a whole. Okay, moving on I will go faster this time. Okay, I know what the blaze is, they are a news channel, generally libertarian, conservative, republican-ish areas. They have Blaze Newsletters so they are throwing stuff out a lot, that generally show reliable. Ads again, people want to be here because they see it. And hey! They put a graph on! And it is from the NASA's Grace satellite. It is kind of hard to see. But that is cool to see, I will want to see what that is. 2 million km of arctic sea ice ate estimated to have been lost. That is a hyperlink, so I will want to see that. And then national snow ice and data center, I will want to see that. The do have a photo, photos are good. They do not say much about the author Justin Haskins. They do show the date though so it's kind of ironic.  This is an interesting point I do want to see that study. It's new, it's strange, the use people like Professor Ronnie Glud from the department of biology at SDU, they use students up above, they use NASA, they use a press, wherever the press is at. SO they use a lot of outside sources. But it is a strange point. I am still going to put it around the 9-ish point.More By using a spate of outside sources, the strange point becomes more and more reliable Climate.nasa.gov okay. This says land ice has been losing mass in both Antarctica and Greenland too. They show a graph here, they show another graph, okay. Okay, that is true, I want to see the study by University of Southern Denmark. Can I copy that? I can't. Well I found the blaze one (first result on the list) well if I just click on that then it can take me to it. Wattsupwiththat.com noabsolutely not. This iswattsupwiththat, that is a terrible name. I mean they have a lot of bloggers that they quote as liking their thing, but that totally draws away, and this site looks like somelike I could have made it, well maybe something better. But that is going to way drop it, because that is one of the first links they had.  By using a spate of outside sources, the strange point becomes more and more reliable. Advertisements, social media pages and kairotic situations make this more reliable. However, the author uses an unprofessional looking site, wattsupwiththat, to drive their point. A website like this completely destroys credibility. Okay that was in March. Another two minutes. Okay. The Switch, Washington Post, we have ads again.  Christain Davenport. It's looks like March 30, so it's not too far back. So they kind of just tell us what it is. Lots of ads. Okay, from a distance. That's not So it's the time it happened. It talks about its importance. December 2015 that was a while back and this was March 30. Oh yeah, what year? It'd be good to have the year. They're not quoting much people. An emotional Musk comment. Oh, so Elon Musk is an individual person. And incrediblebut they're not telling us who Musk is. Good, okay, so they're using people. But they're using everyone from SpaceX. Can they have somebody from, like a witness who saw it, or an official. Or say that, hey SpaceX employees were the only ones who were there.  Oh, that's the wrong one. It'd be good to switch those two. Okay, I've gotten look up who Elon Musk is. He went to Stanford. Wikipedia is sometimes is helpful. Okay, there's a lot of stuff on him. I mean there's a ton. So I'm going to trust whoever he is. But a flight-proven rocket. Let's see about that. The Falcon X. I wonder if it's on here. Let's see. What does Wikipedia say. Doesn't say much of anything. So that's builds up their credibility again. Okay. So Elon MuskMore reliable: Elon Musk is a reliable source and even has worked with the president. Having much experience with science/engineering, the reader finds the source more reliable.This source is less reliable, because they don't provide outside sources, they don't tell us who Musk is, and they don't tell us about the author.So this is after looking, but overall. I put it down a little bit because I forgot to look up the author. Okay, two minutes again. Reliability. Daily K-O-S, whatever KOS is. They have a lot of stuff. Democrats, Republicans,  Okay, you can join a mailing list. Immigration, healthcare. So it looks like all the kairotic situations. Laura Clawson,  Once again, who is Laura? It doesn't show here, that is lame. They have comments, a lot of people commented. And they have ads. Let's see what this is. They say which people are. They've got hashtags. So what is this? Like a millennial. From the photo, she might actually be. That's fine, though, because it connects it and gets people to look. Hashtags, you would think would drive away from reliability, but having it on the side there, it might be a good thing. I've never thought of that. Okay, I want to see that. It's saying hey, it's become harder. You actually say how much it has become harder by. Because it could be 0.0001% in the last 30 years, which is technically true, but really, that's not harder. So I want to see, that hey, in the US, 25% of the workforce has reported having a harder time getting a job. Say who gave the survey. Okay, so they use a person, hey, you know this is my issue here. And then, another person, this is my issue. They used the Washington Post, which is the last one we looked at. Is that that red-headed lady? Let's check it out.Just checking to see if there's an image. Nope, it's not her. Except they don't say that. This attack on Republicans right here. It, that seems like a personal attack on people who especially support Trump. It seems kind of harsh. Like the author is trying to infer using a fallacy, that wow, these Republicans don't care about better care, they're not even humans. Which is really, I would say, cool, this looks like a good article, but this might be just kind of an op ed. Like you have to be extremely respectful when you write an op ed or it just takes away from it. And I'm actually going to put it at a 5. Let's find out if they actually, Laura Clawson. Hate those ads, they're so annoying. Let's see. Is this Judith Graham? Isn't this Judith Graham, no she was in the other. So what, she takes you to another article so you have to find another thing. That makes it really hard. I don't know why she didn't just put something like this This is confusing. A lot of stuff. Job openings due to growth. Is this supposed to be about the economics. Some went down, some went way down. But I mean, not like that bad. Okay, It's going to stay about there. There's one survey discovered. Workforce crisis.Which is good I guess. Using .org's help to drive an authors point. Using other journalists to make one's point deters from the authors credibility. The first hyperlink led to another hyperlink, a riddling nuisance. The author also has no established credibility and they don't create much of one with their tone.When he uses a source lesser than that. Even if it is an op ed.Publishing date, yes. Like how current it is, yeah, that one, that weird one, wattsupwiththat, it was around the same time, but it wasn't a good, like if someone's posting something like, we're talking about healthcare, and they share something from like 4 years ago that has nothing to do with it, like 2014-2024, that was a little weird. Hyperlinks are a huge thing. Sources cited at end, I didn't really look at that. It's kind of an afterthought cause you have hyperlinks anyway.The way the article is written. A lot of them sounded professional, so I wasn't so worried about syntax, grammar, diction, any of that. Sometimes diction is good, one time I kind of paused, supremacy was kind of word verbage to use. How reliable it is. They had news, they had op ed. I don't think it necessarily deters, they just have to establish their ethos. Your emotional response. Like that, an emotional response, not really. Like the Blaze one, I generally like the Blaze, the website as a whole, but they used something like that, that would be an interesting thing to read about, the oceans are melting, but it's good, you know they're saying that. Well, that's interesting, I'd like to hear about that, but they used the wattsupwiththat.
