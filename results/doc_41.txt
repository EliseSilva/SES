NPR. That's typically a rather credible source I believe. Pretty well-known. They do a lot of news. I haven't really paid attention before so I don't really know how reputable they are, but I know I've heard of them. Oh that's not the right button. There it is.We wrote about it and everything. This seems more like a sentence that you would find in a text message than one that would be in a news article. Perhaps they're just trying to have a less formal tone.  That's one of the problems with federalism. It's also one of the advantages though. Different states can pass different laws. In some states some things are illegal. In other states they're perfectly fine. So I know that's true. I haven't read much from that. I know it has some news and articles and things. A few of the articles I've read from there have mostly been. Well they're definitely opinionated. But that is a given. It's just that they were kind of extremely opinionated. Maybe the people are just the passionate about their topic. I don't know how that relates to this article though.I kind of agree with this. It's important to focus on career jobs but, some things that are essential to education have nothing to do with your career. And I'm planning on going into English, but I've taken a few dance classes. I really like dance. Does that mean I should spend my entire time just focusing on English? I would find it really boring after a while. There has to be a variety. I mean, obviously you have to specialize in something, that's what degrees are for, but... There still has to be some variety in the education. Or you just get a narrow-minded view of the world. Okay first of all, I don't understand how this title could actually be true. Melting sea ice is helping Arctic animals. That just seems like a contradiction of everything I've heard, forever. Including at zoos. And on National Geographic. And everything. I haven't heard of the Blaze. I don't know how reliable that is. I'm not exactly a news aficionado, so there could definitely be a very reputable, well-known news station that I have never heard of, but if I've heard of it, it typically means it's pretty well known. But if I haven't it could still be really well-known, it's just I don't know. I haven't heard of it. And the logo doesn't really inspire much confidence in me either. Maybe it reminds me too much of, um, texts where they don't bother to capitalize anything. They'll just string it together. There should be a that right there I think. Cause without it it's just sort of a jumpy sentence. And that, being as it's the very first line of the page, just sort of makes me wonder. That should be accompanied. That just bugs me. When was this released? April 2nd. Hmm. They have a National Snow and Ice Data Center? I've never heard of that. All right.Apparently that is a thing. National Snow and Ice Data Center. Oh that looks pretty official. Mmm. That's with NASA. Oh. That looks really official. Mmm. I don't know.  Okay so this is talking about how it's potentially bad for the environment. It doesn't say anything about the animals though. So I guess it could be good short term for the animals. But what happens when there is no more ice? That probably would be very bad. I'm gonna take a more middle ground on this. That name sounds familiar. Elon Musk. I know I've heard that. I don't know where from though. What do they mean by flight-proven rocket? You mean, a rocket that can fly? Isn't that what a rocket is supposed to do? Why is this news, exactly? Oh, it's been reused! That's cool. Washington Post. I've heard of them. I know they do news, so that automatically improves my opinion of them. Ooh. Sorry. I didn't realize where that was coming from at first. It was a video about the rocket.
