Your voice is being recorded, please think out loud, okay. Well, it may reduce teen pregnancies maybe, probably not, but maybe. Oh okay, so without doing any. Well, nrp, generally reliable I'd say. It is a recognized group, reliable I guess. I wouldn't call it super reliable. Well I would probably do a bunch of cross-referencing I'd probably just cross reference some stuff with places I know are credible. The biggest thing is that they are well-known, it would be risky to lie and try and get away with it, because they are so big, someone would call them out. What would make is unreliable if I felt like it was stuff that I knew and disagreed with or if it said things that contradicted other known sources. Its well-known. saying things that contradict what I already know, saying things that contradict other trusted sources.I mean, it makes sense. But I can see if there would be another view, the opposite side as well. Well, it is well-known and it really isn't that far out there. If it was more of an out there statement. I would be a little bit more skeptic. It is not trying to intrude or nothing has been said, experiments have been done before, I think if there was more research for anything people are going to be more quick to say it is reliable. its well known, and its not far-fetched/out there.  more cross references, more people agreeing with it, and more evidence to support them. They need more people on board, they need more evidence, they need more cross references, they need more proof I guess. The Overlooked Christian Disciple that sounds cool. I see here they have evidence, they have research, they have stuff to back what they are saying. They have several things to back what they are saying. It is just kind of my natural, I naturally take things with a grain of salt. Time and a lot of thought processing, and effort put into it is what convinces me over time I think, what makes it less reliable is that it assumes I believe that global warming is this massive problem. I don't think it is as big of a problem that it is made out to be as, it is kind of blown out of proportion. Not to say that I don't think it is a complete problem, I just don't think it is as big as the media or politicians like us to think so. So I think that since the article is based off of that assumption, that that is what I believe or think, I am like, and I am pretty sure this could be a reliable source. Like I am pretty sure stuff is melting, but I don't think that warrants the response it has been getting. Multiple sources of evidence.It assumes I believe in global warming, which I don't. Okay. Well there were a bunch of other sources that supported it, it's not saying something too far-fetched. What makes this less reliable to me? Nothing really. I just think I wouldn't give it a 10 because I am naturally. other sources say the same thing, pretty reasonable claim.I naturally take things with a grain of salt.No, I can actually believe that. I believe it and I think it is reliable because I have actually seen it. Personal experience is definitely the biggest thing that makes it more reliable. personal experience.the fact that politicians can blow things out of proportionWhat makes it also reliable to me, is that politicians can use an emergency, blow it out of proportion, to get more stuff passed, they can use stuff like that. Did I go too fast?
