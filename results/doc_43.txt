Okay, so thinking out loud: The original article seems kind of bland, just from first glance, because it doesn't have too many sources. just a couple of quotes and opinions. But most of the sources are here in these links. So this second one that you click on, I mean I haven't read though all of it. I don't know if I have time. I guess it is kind of short. But then again when it says stuff like this  it's like well why? I guess I need to keep reading. But they don't really list the benefits. I guess maybe here: The risk rises for women who smoke or are over 35. But then they say, It is much worse to have a woman who is hypertensive to be pregnant than to be on birth control pills. So after skimming though this Again, they are very short articles so I can't say how credible they are. Here probably the most credible thing they have. It looks like it is an actual research study. So I guess that is them quoting from this research referring to the research article opened before. And then that is also supposedly in there referring to the above sentence. Okay.So they keep sourcing themselves. I'm probably spending too much time on this, but I don't know. I mean they say But researchers say and they don't have a source for it, so I'd say it is not too credible. So I guess I am putting the reliability at 5 right now. I still don't know quite how I feel on that. I may change that. It's not my final answer. I mean they do have some good sources, but a lot of it looks like them just sourcing their own opinions over and over again, saying why this should be safe. I mean I guess it is in the middle. Maybe this is just ignorant of me, but I feel like a lot of opinions are like that. They just source themselves. Maybe if I had time to go more in-depth to all the articles they keep sources themselves to, I'd be able to see if ultimately they really are credible. But at first glance, it's kind of like okay, you got like one legitimate source in there that is not yourself. It's in the middle. I'm going to leave it at 5. Quoting the research from Krishna Upadhya is what gives this article the most credibility because it was an actual research done by a college, not just opinions from the same news site. This source seems less reliable the more they source themselves, because the other articles, at first glance, look like the news site's opinions with one fact to support them. Also, when they state that. But researcher say there is no evidence that adolescents are at greater risk from birth control pills than adult women they also don't have a source, which makes them less reliable. Okay, it seems somewhat reliable, at least at first glance, because the author of this article builds up an ethos for themselves; when I helped create the Savannah College of Art and Design blah, blah, blah She's talking about her own success. Maybe if I clicked on this link connected to the word success I could see more. But as far as they don't have any sources explaining why this works, at least I haven't looked at it yet. Maybe it is down here referring to the link attached to significant curricular improvements. I'll look that up so I can look into it and see if the sources make it more reliable. Okay here we are Nearly 40 years and tens of thousands of gainfully employed alumni later, I'm happy to say that we've been a success. Click on that. Okay it takes us to an employment study. Again, really no I mean, it's convincing, but there are really no sources besides saying Hey, these businesses have been looking for this. Sounds more like an op ed. Key findings. Okay, here we go. 98% of combined undergraduate and graduate respondents reported being employed, pursing further education or both within 10 months of education. Okay, she is saying why theirs works. 99% of master's degree students and 98% of bachelor's degree graduates reported being employed, pursuing further education or both.So that seems pretty reliable, so we know this actually does work. So maybe that gives them more reliable, because they've tested this. For 40 years, they've been doing this. Okay. So here's another op ed it looks like supporting this. It also has sources. Okay, so it looks even more reliable to me. I only put it at 9, because it doesn't really compare it to other it doesn't really have a counter argument. It doesn't say, This is what the other universities are like. Maybe other universities also have a high percentage rate of being employed. The qualities that make this source more reliable to me are the 40 years of running a school based on these principles, and the few studies that also support the argument. Also, another credited opinion editorial was cited in the article for support. The qualities that make this source less reliable is that there were no counterarguments or evidence to suggest that perhaps other universities, who still use the old fashioned way of teaching, also have high rates of employment after graduation. So at first glance it looks pretty credible. It has multiple quotes it looks like from multiple people oh wait no, that's press release and press release, a professor. It has a lot of data from NASA or maybe that is the same link. Who knows, maybe I'll have to look at that. At first glance it looks pretty reliable. It has two studies; it has multiple quotes. It actually explains why, not just opinions multiple links or clicks to understand what is going on. So I'd say it looks pretty reliable at first glance. I guess I'll look this up. Okay so it looks like it is a inaudible news site. Melting sea ice may lead to more life in the sea. Okay there they are talking about the melting sea ponds that were mentioned in the study, so that's good. It talks about the ecosystems. It looks like a legitimate study and it actually explains what is going on. And then it also has another link to a paper on why.That's really reliable right there. So I'm going back to the first article. So I'm not sure if these are pointing to some quotes in the article  Oh, this is from the press release about the article. That's good. So that's good it has quotes. Increased productivity in plant and animal life, that is kind of a big jump considering it is only mats of algae and bacteria that can evolve in melt ponds. Like what about other things that are in the arctic. Like polar bears What are they going to do? I'm going to click on this link from NASA sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.I'm not sure what just happened. Some pop up ad. But so it looks like yes, the sea ice is down. They have this chart, which also makes it very reliable. They have lots of sources. Okay so they do have this counterargument here speaking about the quote USA Today declared the loss of sea ice 'terrifying,' but global warming skeptics have long suggested these claims are overblown when put into perspective. So that's it. Okay so the rest of it is talking about the reduction of sea ice. It doesn't really get back to helping arctic animals. Hmm.OK, so back here.I don't know. Maybe I'm picking apart the argument, not so much the credibility. I think it is very credible, but maybe not for what they're going for. They've backed up a lot of things, but not kinda they made a connection that mats of algae and bacteria can evolve but not so much how that would help arctic animals. I mean, maybe it is supposed to be common sense. It didn't really reinforce that point. The qualities that make this source reliable are the multiple studies and sources that support this article. There is the NASA article, the research, and a graph to demonstrate the article's argument. What makes this source seem less reliable to me is that there is really no connection between the growth of bacteria and algae benefiting the arctic animals, which should e focused on more if that is what the article is about. Okay so at first glance, I don't know. I'd put it at 5, because I mean the logic makes sense, but again it doesn't look they've had a lot of sources. I think they just have this quote down here from the SpaceX president. But for all I know they could be making up stuff there even though it sounds legitimate. So if I look up real quick. Oh. They have a video. Okay. That gives them more credibility. So I'd give it more reliability. This source seemed more reliable because it had a video and quotes form SpaceX's president and chief technology officer. I guess I'm putting it at a 7, because still there are not a lot of sources for what they are actually saying. Maybe it is in the video. I should watch that.Okay, so I guess if it's just a five the rating, I'm approaching it with skepticism. It's right in the middle; I'm not sure whether to trust it or not. And if it's past a 5, I pretty much trust it. A 9, I pretty much trust it but I can accept that there is something wrong with it, with the argument.I'm putting a 7, because for all I know it could be biased, because of who they are quoting and the sources they have. But for the most part I would trust it. If I had to ultimately depend on what this article is giving me, I would probably look for other resources. But for the majority I would trust it. So that's why. The fact that the article could possibly be biased, based on the quotes the article is using and who the quotes are from members of the very organization who 'made history.' Moves to the next page and skims the article. Rates it an 8. Okay for this part I would believe this source. It is very recent. It looks like it has links. It talks about surveys. It kind of explains why there is this crisis, which is more than opinion. It is actually explaining. Yeah so now I'll look it up. Okay, so it just links back to another op ed, which could probably also be reliable, but It looks like it is. It has a lot of quotes; it has the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Yeah. Okay, it looks fairly legitimate. Yeah.It seems fairly reliable. At the same time, no counterarguments so I don't know if there is another side to this that I don't have. I don't know if that should affect if that is reliable or not but I always do, because if someone only provides you with one side of the argument, how do you really know if that is reliable or not; kinda got to tell me what the other side is, instead of just degrading them like they did at the bottom. So I'd give them the same credibility. The sources that the article cites the survey and opinion editorial look very legitimate. Again, there is no counterargument, so I am unaware if there is another side to the argument that I am not aware of the could possible change my perspective on the issue.
