Well first I looked at the top left of the thing it was NPR, so you know it is reliable. it's National Public Radio. So I would rate it pretty high on reliability. After reading the site's links I would probably rate it at a 9. So I'm just going to google the title of the article Over the counter birth control pills.So now I am looking at the other websites that pulled up, npr.org being the first one. Then it looks like the websites get not as reputable. I am not familiar with any of these. Teen Vogue I mean, they are more of magazine form; less scientific, more gossipy.  This article does look pretty good. Goes back out to the Google results page. I would go to the other .org sites, just because they are organizations, not .coms. So I would say out of all these source that popped up, NPR is the most reliable. Goes back to the survey and ranks the article an 8. I still think this article is an 8, just because I don't see any official study or hospital research study that has taken place. As it is an NPR website, they do tend to have more reliable and reputable sources. They are paid to give national news to the public. Also, the links that they have their page do lead to other institutes.The thing that makes it less reliable to me is the fact that it is a topic that many other website and magazines are using, and I don't see any MD or other sources. It looks like these are mostly op-eds perhaps We can look at their sources; we can look and see.This one looks more reliable than most of the other ones. The fact that it is an institute (the Guttmacher Institute). The topic itself seems to be backed by some scientific/medical data, but you would have to go to a different website to view them and ensure they are reliable. So now with this Huffpost I am looking first at where it is from, I am looking at the author. She is the president and founder of Savannah College of Art and Design, so she is reputable, she has got education. And then it looks like it is recent.  March 20 looking at the date. And then, looking further down at what they topic is, how it is a third way for universities. We can begin to see that she is quoting things like CNN. She is using the vernacular of the professor, so she has spent time working in college. She is familiar with the art colleges and catalogs of the day and so I would say that it is fairly reliable. She knows what she is talking about. I would probably do an 8, just because the Huffington Post. I am not familiar with the other articles that they've published. So maybe I could look up Paula Wallace herself. Let's see her history. She is the president and founder of SCAD. She has got many academic degree programs in 5 different locations worldwide. She has earned many rewards; she has been honored as Entrepreneur of the Year. She currently serves on the National Advisory Board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. So I would definitely consider her a reliable source. And then I would look for an article, perhaps regarding this topic. Career specific education seems to be the topic and that they are trying to focus more on different degrees. So she is trying to advocate for those who are trying to balance experience, but also trying to She is advocating for the arts, obviously, so that seems like a profession that might be not as popular within millennials. Or it could be more popular based off of. Hmm, let's see She is saying universities have to adapt meaning strengthening the curriculum Okay. So there are a lot of changes going on with the millennials, and what qualities employers want from new hires. Universities should marry the intellectual and the practical in the same classroom. And so I would, overall, based off of Paula Wallace's bio on the Huffington Post and she's got several other articles.She has written for the Huffington Post, all dealing with the same type of topic or design. This one Athletics stoke Artistry. She has other sports, quotes, persons. So I would say that this is a fairly reliable source. I wouldn't necessarily use it in a research paper perhaps, just because it is still someone giving their opinion. You have to look at the facts that she is trying to say. She is quoting studies, so maybe you would just go to that study instead of reading her quoting in. In this case, in this article The Athletics to Artistry article, she quotes a 2006 study by the Alberta Schools' Association. I would try and find that study herself rather than her quoting it. So I would say put it at an 8, because it does take you to the sources that you can use. She is a qualified person to write on such articles. She has received awards and has written several articles within the same subject. While she does work within the areas that she writes, she is quoting many surveys or studies. I would simply go to those studies and cite them directly. She is paid to write her opinion, it's more of an Op Ed. Okay looking again first at where it is from The Blaze. It has news, radio channels, it has advertisements for meditation, Christian Discipline, the ads all along the sides. Looking at Justin Haskins the author, Global Warming Fail: Study finds melting sea ice is actually helping Arctic animals. So we can assume that he is somehow related to the study of melting ice, but at this point we can't be sure he has recent data.Oh NASA. Then quoting both sites here are linked. He has got graphs, a source from NASA. So the fact that he is, the majority of the paper appears to be quotes in and of themselves. That does not necessarily mean that Justin Haskins knows what is exactly going on. He certainly could be knowledgeable, but that doesn't mean that he is a biologist at SDU or a professor or someone who deserves to be writing about this topic.But it seems to be, a lot of it based off of university research and so with that I would say it is pretty reliable. I would give it a 9 probably, just because at this point it doesn't sound like he is writing all that much. He is just paraphrasing and quoting what other people have found. And so for that fact I would rate it highly. And then I could go to the NASA website and look at the NASA articles themselves. So based off that that makes it more reliable to me. But I still have a hard time using articles such as this from the Blaze or from the Huffington Post on anything other than perhaps opinion editorials or some other light writing topic. I wouldn't base a research essay an articles such as these, so He is quoting NASA and many other universities, he himself is not doing much writing. He is putting together the words of other peoples' work and publishing. It makes it more reliable to me because you could easily find these actual studies and quote them instead of the author.Rating it a 9 does seem a bit high if I was not going to be using it. I might I rated it as a 9, because it is reliable in the fact that the research is Like if I were to quote anything I would simply, like here Professor Ronnie Glud at the Department of Biology at SDU. I would quote Professor Glud rather than quoting my friend Justin here. Qualities that make it less reliable to me are the fact that we don't know who Justin Haskins is. We can look him up, I guess, and that could make it a little bit more. Where is this from? The Blaze, Justin Haskins. Okay so he is an executive editor, op-eds mainly, so this is again his opinion. He is being paid to express some sort of persuasive piece using different rhetorical devices. His rhetoric will be a little bit different. And it would be in a research paper let's see he is in the Republican Party, da da da, African conflict, he graduated summa cum laude from the University of Richmond Virginia. He has got a masters. He can write well, but that doesn't mean that he knows much about Global Warming. While he can write well and is educated, it doesn't mean necessarily qualified to write about global warming, which is why he is mostly quoting and summarizing.I would probably lower this down after looking at who Justin Haskins is. Oh, I guess I'd move that back up to a 9, since it is the overall source. So I would lower the top bar down to an 8, just because of the qualifications that Justin Haskins has to write this.I could probably look up Professor Glud University of SDU, Biology and see what other other studies he has done. Ronnie N. Glud. This does not look like Oh, SDU Biology. So let's see. It is in some weird language. Let's look at this other one. Professor Ronnie N. Glud. Let's see SDU Institute of Biology. We are not sure which SDU is, so that is not quite as helpful. However, the fact that it is a professor of marine biology, while it could be a Danish biology department, it looks like it is him.Our Danish friend here. He seems like an intelligent man. Let's look up the NASA then. So this is more the fact of global warming, not so much as about what Haskins is saying in regards to how global warming is healthy.That second link I saw looked pretty good.So if I was to use any research, I would probably use NASA as my first source rather than Haskins. A lot of these are knowledgeable, their research, this data. We know NASA to be a more reputable and trustworthy source than this The Blaze article. And so yeah. Okay so this new one now, we've got The Washington Post. I am pretty familiar with other things, op eds, that The Washington Post has published, with other classes.So it is Christian Davenport, March 30 it is recent, is has a video right in front of the rocket. I am not familiar with Elon Musk but we could certainly look him up quite quickly. So overall reliability it is reliable. He's got the times, the specifics, with the video. He's got specifications about this rocket. It is showing how the rocket is working. I doubt that he is a rocket scientist. He didn't add anything about the building of this rocket, but he has certainly done his research. Based off the video and I would probably rate it pretty high again, just because it is a means to find more information. So I would probably put this as an 8 again.The Washington Post. It is more reliable than the past ones that I've put pretty high for, such as The Blaze. I would rate The Washington Post much higher than any of the previous ones. Huffington Post is pretty good, but overall, based off who he is writing for, what the topic is, and he has a video with certain data things here points to the stats in the corner of the video; he's got speed, altitude. Oh research, well who Elon Musk is and what he has done. Smart guy. He's got a Wikipedia page. Entrepreneur, engineer, inventor, investor. He is the founder and CEO of SpaceX. So definitely an intelligent man, with the ability to do such a thing. His net worth is $17.4 billion. That is more than pretty much anyone that I certainly know of. And so the fact that we are now studying something that Elon Musk has done, it makes it more likely that this the original article is very reputable, very reliable, would use in other writings. Now I could look up SpaceX and see. other stories about this one, about launching a flight proven rocket. So the other things that come up are Florida Today and The probably launched it at Florida, Kennedy Space Center yeah. And so we can look at Space News, other videos of it. This probably has a video with it. Definitely another Emre Kelly author of this article the same topic. We don't want to hear about Jim referring to the ad, but we do want to hear about the rocket. So SpaceX, Falcon 9. We can look into what Falcon 9 is. Go to SpaceX's website itself. See a production video about it. So headquarters. Definitely pretty spectacular. They're trying to do such a thing, so It's also cool that a rocket outside of NASA has been built. They are trying to make it years, figures, how big it is, and we can even see the pricing of it. For the Falcon 9, $62 million and we can see how much it would take to get to Mars, the facilities. So I would definitely think that this is a good research. Overall, this is reliable because SpaceX and Elon Musk are well known and have money. With the money they have, they are able to hire the scientists they need, thus able to quote their research and post the video of the launch on the article.Less reliable to me  we still haven't looked up Christian Davenport. So his things are regarding space, planes Jeff Bezos, Bezos with his Amazon, and so let's see! Different Bezos. Just some rich guy wanting to go to space. $500 million of his own money to do it, so I think with the amount of time that Davenport has been working here “ since 2000 “ with all of it in aviation and aerospace, I think that he is still a reliable source. The other things that make it less reliable: he is not an actual scientist. He does not work for Elon Musk. So he is going off the same things we are. He doesn't work for Elon Musk nor is he a rocket scientist, so he is doing the same research that we would if we were writing about this topic. He would watch videos, interview employees, and find future plans of SpaceX. He may not know that without asking.31:49ay. The Daily Kos. I don't know, I am not familiar with that. Automatically putting it further down. I should base it off past articles that I've already seen. Also, I shouldn't have put The Blaze so high. Anything typed in The Blaze isn't very reliable, so thinking back on that it is not CNN or anything. It's not New York Times. He does have this looks to be quoted from something. The world's unprecedented and desperate come to mind.  We've got a lot of quotes. He's got 75, I'm not sure, 40 comments. So that I mean people read it. 40 people out of all of America, you know. There's a growing crisis in care for disabled and elderly people. I mean, that's a problem that affects a lot of people. And job crisis. So I think that is definitely current. We look at the problem, we can look at what makes him credible, why is he writing about this or her “ Laura Clawson. We can look at what her argument is, what her claim is and begin to see what she wants, what assumptions she is making. She is assuming that Well, just off of this article we have to assume that there is a crisis within or for disabled and elderly people and then we'll be able to build on that. We have to take that as true. So building upon that she goes growing crisis which then leads to a job crisis. And so then we can look at average wage. . We can look at her reasons, her examples, who she is using.34:19Here's an example: One of seven caregiving positions in Wisconsin nursing homes and group homes were unified , one survey discovered. 70% of administrators reported a lack of qualified job applicants. So when a business can't find the workers it needs the answer is usually that it needs to pay more to compete for workers. But its most likely based off it's an economics problem. If no one is going there, they're not paying high enough. And so they can't compete, no one wants to work there, so they get unqualified workers or they just don't have anyone working there in general at $10/ hour. And so, I think it has become definitely harder. So based off that I would say a 6. I would then look up to see other research that makes it more reliable.So we can see other things that she has written.It seems like she the previous article about SpaceX, he, the author, was pretty much soley focused on those types of articles: space, engineering, aerospace. Whereas this author, she's got one about healthcare and jobs,  and she's got other things about workplace and Arjun Jaikumar.And so this is the New York Times, so perhaps she's it's not her..Really, she looks like she has only one result. All these other links are for different Laura Clawsons. We can see her simply by looking on her profile. She's been there since 2006. So I guess labor editor. That can mean that she's focused on labor. So this article would seem a little bit more reliable. She is now trying to focus her research on such. So she's got lots of tags, diaries Senate Judiciary Committee. So I still don't see that she is that reputable. She just looks like some woman who is writing on her free time, not that she is actually there doing it every day. She's paid for it, obviously, but I see this profile as more kind of like a blog post. It's not necessarily something like Harvard, real studies, MDs would put. It's not that professional. I would still kind of put it. Eh. I wouldn't use this. She using many studies and quotes, basic economics to state the problems. She is using others to solidify her argument and claim.After going to her profile on the Daily KOS, it looked similar to a blog rather than a research/professional writer. While this may not discredit who she is or what she writes about, it makes it less reliable to me.So yeah, based off again that profile. It doesn't look to be professional, so it makes her seem less reliable. It doesn't need to discredit who she is.
