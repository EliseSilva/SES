So it's NPR which is a pretty recognized news organization, so right there the credibility goes up quite a bit at least for me. Of course I don't really know much about this particular topic, but it seems about right. Looks like the have some good sources, Krishna Upadhya. It was published this week. So I'd probably give it a really good reliability. Probably a 9 just because it's not an official documentation of actual statistics that are proving each point. NPR is a recognized news organization that has some credibility. I think what makes it look less reliable, so I'm gonna turn this down to an 8, is just that for me at least there's an absence of actual statistics so it's not like I can prove right away that what they're saying is completely true. There is an absence of included statistics in the actual article to prove each of their points. So I guess everything I just did was for the top. So I might look up. opens google tab recreation contraceptive policy by state.  Oh, that's just not what I need.  recreation contraceptive pills policy by state . So I mean at least for me I feel like I can justify their article pretty quick because all the sources I can trust here are all like NPR which is who I'm trying to justify.Goes back to survey. So probably just gonna keep it there rating 8Next step. So I understand that you are like sources.First, who's Huffington Post.Founder of a college. Probably knows what she's talking about. She's got some experience under her belt. That's not the same. So probably the same as before. Actually I can't see the whole article so that might be different. I might put a 9 actually just cause she sites some people that it's not a number statistics but it's like a citation of a sort I guess, I don't know, but we'll go with a 9. Also, I feel like you can't really google and verify this because at least to me it seems as if a lot of what she's saying is her opinion for what is imperative for a college. So in that mind completely accurate. I'm sure she knows herself slightly sarcastic. So I mean the same. Nothing to shake my trust. Huffington Post is a trusted news organization. Paula Wallace, a contributor, has experience in the field in discussion. The absence of hard fact. It is mostly her opinions on what is imperative for colleges. Ah man there's the facts. That's just intimidating. What is oh, the blaze. So probably, For one thing, it seems like they are taking this statement right here, about nutrients being released into the melt pods and being released by the melting of the ice. And they use this statistics graph to say so that's happening. I don't know, that seems like first of all this is not proven yet. All these things that they expect that it will. And then they're kinda taking this separate fact, how can I explain this better, it's kinda like if I were to say I expect to make a million dollars by competing in the lottery and then I share a statistic of my lottery ticket purchase sales going way up because I don't know that I will, but technically I expect that I will because I'm buying more tickets. So I'll probably actually give this one a 4. for two reasons. First because the source isn't quite as prominent as the first two and then the argument seems a little weak to me. to be taken too seriously. But I mean I don't really watch the news so probably should browse it right. Types 'melted arctic release nutrients'.  Oh there's that one sarcastic tone. So many awesome choices. I'll go with that one. Yeah and these other groups that corroborate their claim so that might go a little bit. I'll probably give it a solid 7. several other groups have made the same claim, which does not make it correct for sure, but it becomes more likely. The Blaze is not quite as prominent a source and some of the reasons supporting the claim were a little weak. That just seems like the best way to put itWashington Post Elon Musk, smart smart guy. K Washington Post looks good. Actually I follow him on twitter and he posts stuff like this all the time. For me this is actually kind of a 10 and that's probably for me personal because first, it's the Washington Post. Just very recognized, very trusted. And second from previous experience I know about this topic. Like this is something that I've kind of followed so I can validate it from this dude, Elon Musk, that what is being said in here is accurate. I'm pretty sure. Like I wouldn't bet my life on it but I'm pretty dang sure. So we'll go two 10s. 'Washington Post is trusted news source. It coincides with past knowledge of the'  'SpaceX' I thought SpaceX was the- probably the name of the group. I guess they call the rockets X21 or whatever. That does not matter. program that I personally have. Seems like it has pretty good sources. Pretty good tracking of this satellite. In depth tracking of satellites instills confidence. One this is all online games to the right. But I guess they could have, which they have this video which seems like they might include some stuff in there. Anyway, I really feel like it's pretty good. I don't know I guess I'll put 'N/A' Not applicable. I feel pretty good about this one. I'm no expert. First, it's the Daily Kos. I've never heard of this Actually, I'm not sure about the whole paying more, but from experience nursing homes are the worst I feel like I might have done one a little lower earlier, but I feel like it's at the same level as that one. The one that was by The Blaze when I first saw it I feel like is about the same, but we'll see. So let's check sources. It's job crisis too, huh. So it's kind of politically affiliated, but it sounds like the end here, which also does not instill a lot of confidence. And also I don't really get their claim other than health people should be paid more. Or, you know? Increasing funding. I feel like it'd be a lot more powerful and I could trust it more easily if I could actually discern what they're trying to say. Starts typing 'home nurses' Well I feel like you can't justify this one with another one  because again it's kinda like an earlier one, I don't remember which one, it was the one about the colleges. It seems these are all opinions backed up by- this is like the opinions of the author backed up by Right here actually it does look like there's some better sourcing, so that might go up a little bit. It's always nice to see some facts even if sometimes it might be a little distracting. 'the inclusion of data and facts as well as outside opinions included in the article'I'm sure there are others that would agree, but she specifically includes some. I must be killing the wolf quick because it's been 20 minutes and I'm pretty far in. First of all, 'Daily KOS is not a largely well known source of information. A lot of the article excerpt appears to be trust opinion rather than any study.' I feel like there's something else that I said, but maybe not. Oh that's political affiliation. And don't get me wrong, I put in the survey that I was republican affiliated. That's really not a strong affiliation. So when I say this, just cause it looks like a more liberal one cause it looks like their going after Paul Ryan. And then down here, clearly Donald Trump. Don't get me wrong, I think Trump is insane. Also, there is affiliation that might make the author analyze the subject from only one point of view. Political point of view, but I'm not gonna write that. Oh wow I definitely went a little quick. I mean like I feel like I answered them fine, I think, I don't know.
