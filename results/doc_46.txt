Ok, I'm not seeing what the url is. All things considered I like that they're giving sources.  Over the counter birth control pills would be safe for teens, researchers say. It does say .org. I don't know what NPR is. That seems pretty credible to me But I would say they did not do this research themselves. This is all sourced. So not a 10. I say 8 or 9. It's just a journalist. They're like news reporters so it could be skewing it, so we're gonna go with 8. 7.5-ish. Make it an 8. 'The url says .org that usually seems to be more credible than .com or something like that. Also, it is a public news station that provides information to a lot of places, so it much be fairle credible, or else they're just being rude to give false information to that many people.Also, they have referred to specific organizations/studies, which gives them credibility.' 'They did not to the research themselves, so they had to refer to someone else. This interpretation of information can be less credible because they more not fully understand the info.' That already doesn't sound. The fact that there's Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in the corner that doesn't seem as credible to me. Oh, she's the president of a college. That is more credible. And since she works at a college and she's talking about universities that seems pretty valid.  Because she is president and founder of a college and she wrote this article, I'm gonna say it's like she didn't do any studies about it, it's just like her personal opinion I'm gonna say it's like a 9 probably. Ok, but I don't like the website that it's on. This looks kinda like buzzfeed. Which buzzfeed I feel like is not very credible. It's funny that I'm looking at their credibility on other uncredible sources. Let's see, I'm trying to find a good. New York Times is another website. K, so it is like a news website. I just don't know if it's like real news. See, blog system. See that's not very credible. Ok so by looking at this uncredible source laughs to tell me whether something else is credible I'm gonna dock this down to an 8. Well, 8.5-ish, just because they don't have like backed up scientific research. The fact that the person writing the article is VERY involved dat-to-day with what she is writing about. She is the president and founder of a college and is writing about a college. That seems pretty legit. The fact that is it published on huffingtonpost.COM. It also has a lack of scientific research and other sources to back it up. This is completely opinion based, which is very biased and views can be skewed. The Blaze Alrighty, I've never heard of The Blaze. That's gross. Justin Haskins.  I don't know what an institute is. This is .org so that's pretty good. It says that he right here references back to screenshot, Justin Haskins wrote this article, so I just wanna see who he is. See if he is a person that's credible. And it seems like he, that's his job. These are all pretty credible. Seems like he knows what he's talking about.  I like that he refers to other places. He has this quote from a professor. He has a graph. I'm gonna see credibility of The Blaze.  Funded by a radio station. So this one seems like pretty credible. Like a 9 credibility. Actually the one before this, I would probably go back down to the 8. For the college one. I would probably say that's more of an 8. This one is a 9. 'The writer, Justin Haskins, has a lot of experience with articles and the topic that this article is about. He has been published on many other news websites. The Blaze, the website that his article is published on, is fully credible. I like that he relates to other credible sources like NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center. He has direct quotes, and he has graphs. Everything about him and this article seem very credible. It isn't a study. All of the information comes from somewhere else. This doesn't have any first-hand data. Wash PostThe Washington Post I think is pretty credible. Christian Davenport. We're gonna see who he is. Ok this one is .edu so this one is an educational website. Like a school thing. Center for Political Studies. University of Michigan. So that seems pretty credible. They even have contact information. He has a Ph.D. in political science. That seems pretty credible. So this dude knows what he's talking about. Just about him. 6 books. Winner of best book in racial politics. Yeah this dude seems super credible. This seems awesome. Let's just look up the credibility of Washington Post. So it actually seems like a pretty credible website too. So now let's read the article. Ok so this guy. We're gonna give it a 9 because he know . Well, he likes talking about political science. This has nothing to do with political science. We're gonna give it an 8. Because he is a person, this like smart dude and he is pretty credible, but that fact that he's writing about something that he's not as knowledgeable in and he kinda makes it seem like he was there and he wasn't, I'm pretty sure, I mean I don't know. The article's great, it's just not. Christian Davenport has a Ph.D., has written six books, and has won the best book for some cool award. He's just a smart dude. This is published on the Washington Post, which is usually pretty credible. He sources the president of SpaceX, has a lot of facts and statistics, and has definitely done his research. Christian Davenport has a Ph.D. in POLITICAL SCIENCE. Not rockets. He doesn't really have a ton of first-hand knowledge about the topic of this article. Daily KosIs this the last one? I think so! Ok so actually I don't do research. So, it says 'reblogged', so this is like a blog. Yeah blogs aren't as credible in my opinion. And this tells you how many social media posts it's been on which isn't important for. So, before we research about it were gonna give it a six. Now we're gonna see who Laura Clawson is. K Twitter is the first thing that pulls up. Dang girl. So she seems pretty credible. K we're gonna look up Daily Kos. This is no longer a credible political website, it's become a mouthpiece for a broken system read from first searched article. These media sources are moderately so strongly biased towards liberal causes read from second searched article. So they are baised. So, obviously there's gonna be bias in any article because you want to be persuasive. Just because they're democratic doesn't mean they're less credible necessarily. This one is harder to find information on, but it seems, Laura Clawson, is pretty legit herself. Daily Kos seems pretty legit. K so now we're gonna read it. I like that they have information and the link to it so you can see it. Lots and lots of facts and information and quotes. I like that. K I'm gonna give this one an 8 too just because Laura Clawson has a PhD so she's pretty smart. And Daily Kos seems just as credible as any other source that I looked at. But not a 10 because I don't know a lot about it and it is skewed to a liberal side.'Laura Clawson has a Ph.D. from Princeton University, which is pretty dang credible if you ask me. There is a lot of strong information in the article. Statistics, facts, quotes, and other things help to give the article credibility. She even has a picture of the topic of the article. 'Daily Kos. Apparantly it is a VERY liberal website, which doesn't necessarily make it less credible, but it may be biased and only show one side of the argument.' I guess maybe I should look up the founder. I'm gonna see about him. He's a communist. Served in army. That's interesting. Bachelor's degree. K so it doesn't look like he has a lot of education. I mean he did go to college, so that's good, but he might not be as credible because he doesn't have a PhD like Laura does. But he's just the founder, so that doesn't really have a lot to do with this specific article. 'I don't like the social media links on the corner of the page. It seems less credible that social media is such a big part of the website'.  It seems less credible here. It has likes and comments. See it just doesn't seem as legit.
