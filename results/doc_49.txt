I think I'm gonna put an 8 for this one.  I mean it's NPRthat's like a known public radio news outlet.  I don't know how much credibility they have writing about health concerns, but, it's relevant too you can see it's written in the last few months . I'm not sure who the author actually is, but I've listened to the radio sothere it is, Rebecca.  Well I guess I have no clue who she is, but I've listened to this show before and it seems pretty reputable.  They also quote some things from other people who know what they're talking about so, seems like a reliable source. I mean yeah I trust it, I honestly don't feel like I need to do more research about it. I'll give it the same, maybe even a 9. known name, previous experience with the source.  'researches say' (they back up their claim with research).Never heard NPR do health news before.  I don't know if they're really an authority on stuff like that. I'm giving it a six right now just because the name Huffington Post popping out to me, I've never really considered it a reliable source.  I've just seen some pretty extreme articles, and some pretty extreme opinions coming out from them.  They're not really a mainstream they're not really in my mind like a credible news source.  I mean I'm giving it a six though because it seems like Paula Wallace does have some credibility speaking about the topic, she's the founder of a college of art design and can speak a little bit to the question here.  Has some arguments.  .  Yeah I mean they obviously have an agenda, you can, reading here  It was started as kind of a liberal leftist source. I feel like the more I know about it the farther this would go down.  My initial opinion's a little bit higher than what I'm putting after research. The author definitely makes it more reliable.  Has experience on subject. 'Huffpost' at the top.Yeah.  I don't know. Interesting.  Honestly I know that the Blaze is kind of a  more controversial, and even this topic is more controversial, but I'd give it an 8 at start just cause, um, funny enough I just feel like the article supports my own opinions, and feelings about the subject.  So that makes me, right of the bat, think that it's a more reliable source.  I mean they're citing studies, researchers, they have a graph from NASA, and I mean even the picture at the top makes me think, 'Oh wow.  There's a littlelittle penguin or something jumping around this ice pond that's being helped.'  So I feel like, pictures graphs, all that's creating reliability. I'm curious how biased they are.  Yep, like I thought before they're pretty right leaning. Um yeah. That being said, like, I still feel like they put together a good reliable article. Their opinions match my own, using graphs and pictures, quoting NASA and other reliable sources. I know this is a very biased news source.  I don't really see the other view.  Although since I agree with their view, it doesn't bother me so much. I mean, I can just go ahead and talk as I'm reading this, but first thing I see is Washington Post.  I always felt, I don't know, it seems like a more traditional newspaper source.  Not necessarily biased either way in my opinion.  Um, they're talking about Elon Musk's SpaceX which is actually a really interesting subject to me.  And you can tell that the title is very professional and straight forward.  Even something as simple as the ads on the side of the screen you can tell they're not the sameas much entertainment type ads. Talks about loans, other newspaper articles, UPS even.  They have a video that I'm looking at right at the beginning, I would have watched that first if I had a link to it, which shows actual footage, I mean you can't make up footage.  There's not really bias to it at all.  Honestly I'm gonna give this one a 10. Look them up on Wikipediafunny that I see Wikipedia as a credible source.  Oh interesting so it's published and circulated in Washington D.C.  It's been around for 150 years.  'Democracy dies in darkness.'  Hmm. Yeah, I mean reading more about its reputation just gives me a better impression. I honestly didn't realize all those things before.  That's a national wide newspaper.  So I'll write down some of those things I said before The title at the top Washington Post, the headline is not biased, there is a video with real footage of what is being talked about.  Ads on the side of the screen seem more professional. Also something that I'll mention is that this one seems like it's a longer article.  It's not a longer article I wonder why I said that.  Maybe it's just a moreit's a thicker article.  I just get the impression it's more credible. What makes it less reliable  Eh.  Can't think of anything. Can't think of anythingIt's a good source. Daily Kos, never heard of that. Okay, interesting.  This one's kind of weirdI'd give it a 5. Just because I have no idea what this name is.  Looking at these tops at the top  they're just kind of weird.  They're not really regular topics.  I mean sure the first few are but then there's things like Obamacare, climate change, healthcare, GOP, Russia 2018, I feel likethey're not stable, they're just what's popular.  You can tell by the title too.  The tone is different,  Oh, and it's a jobs crisis, too.  What I did like that made some things reliable here  is that they just kind of regurgitate a lot of things that other surveys and other facts have found.  There wasn't a ton of opinion, I mean they even quoted the Washington Post, which I just rated pretty high.  So it was interesting to see that from them.  But yeah, only gonna give them a 5, no idea who they are.  But I would probably take the facts out of the article and use those. Let's seeDaily Kos. Interesting, so it's like a blog.  So this seems like the writer's super unprofessional. Weird seems like their content is just created by a bunch of random people. Honestly after reading that I think it's even less reliable. Using other reliable sources. Never heard of it before, I guess their authors kinda just come from wherever? It's basically a blog.  Yeah definitely about publishing dateI'm not really sure what the currency of facts is, so that's why I'm not putting it. I feel like all of these affect the way I do it. Sorry I don't know if that really helps.
