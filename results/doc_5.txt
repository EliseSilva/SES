Well, first off, with the title of it, the over-the-counter birth control pills would be safe for teens, researchers say, I'm an in intro to family processes class at the moment, and the term researchers say is something that I have learned to be pretty wary of, because many times, the media just kind of takes the actual studies the researchers do, but what they actually report in the media is not at all what the researchers end up saying, in their reports.That doesn't mean that this one is necessarily doing the same thing, but most people aren't necessarily going to go to the actual study and the article to check it out, which would be the most reliable source in this case, I'd say.This is more of a news, especially if it's NPR, it's affiliated, it's not unbiased, it's not straight from the researchers, it's from the media.They have a direct quote from the article, though, well, they have a direct quote from one of the people in the article, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the quote is from the article itself. Probably not so reliable, that's what I would probably say. It does directly quote one of the researchers involved in the study, which makes it more reliable. It references a specific study performed and published in a qualified medical journal. Generally speaking, news reports are much less reliable than the source itself. This is from NPR and as such would not be an unbiased report. I would much rather read the source material directly from the study.I decided to go and look for the actual article. On google, I went to the NPR article, and followed the link to the actual study that was done, and in this case, it, I thought it was talking a little bit more about, not completely what the article was talking about, this  was just talking about the safety. Whereas the actual article  itself was talking more about how commonly they are able to be found. It also spent a lot more time focusing on adult women as well, and this is fairly fairly reliable, I'll guess I'll change it to a 4 not a 3, but it doesn't give nearly as much information as I would want it to, as would help a lot in this situation. I'd just rather always go with the actual article itself, that's where you get the primary source. A Third Way for Universities  what does this mean. Oh career-specific education. And classic liberal learning. Oh so liberal arts versus career development. Who's writing this, though.  Okay, so she's writing about why her university works. I am a very cynical person, that's what I'm figuring out right now. It's way better written than the one I was just reading, though. It seems more like a campaign, though, an op ed, a persuasive kind of paper. So it's a liberal arts school that also focuses on career, it just basically takes both. Does it cite that source that it's using. That one, that one's pretty good. I'm going find this article to see if there's any other things that they use. Huffington Post, is that where this is. Yes, and the Huffington Post is what, a newspaper. I think so, I've heard of it. So it's in a newspaper it's journalism, still media. Still not a primary source. Does it have citations? Okay, I don't like that it doesn't have citations. I can't find those, and those are one of the first things that I want to look for, if it's a non-scholarly article. This is a pretty good media story to say, but it's a lot more of a persuasive essay, I'd say. I'm still going to put it as a 5. I would use that, but maybe not as hard facts. It gives a personal experience backed up with thousands of alumni to show that this 'third way' actually works. It reads a lot like a persuasive essay. It is written by the founder of Savannah College, which makes her unable to be unbiased. I would need to take into account the bias of the author. No citations.So I guess still what I would say is that it's written by the founder of this college, the Savannah College, which makes her unable to be unbiased. She doesn't want to portray her school in a negative way, and there's a very good chance that it is working.Because citations make the world go round. Oh, okay, the blaze. Okay, that's not even like Huffington Post, cause there's Huffington Post, which I've actually really heard of, I've never even heard of the blaze. No sort of credentials whatsoever on this author's name. What study finds that melting sea ice is actually helping artic animals? Because that is not something that we have been hearing for a really long time. Okay, they have the study link, so I'll go look at that for a minute. Climate change is accompanied by  Hmm. This one is hard because it's going against what a lot of researchers have been saying and lot of what we've been hearing since we've been growing up, and so it makes me a little bit more hesitant to believe that this is true, especially with lack of recognition of the title, no sort of, it's clearly just a reporter writing, otherwise there would be some sort of credentials next to the name. So this one's pretty low, I'd probably say like a 3, maybe even a 2. I'm going to say a 2 because I don't feel like this is very reliable. And okay, so the source of this article, this table actually, is NASA's Grace satellites. I don't really see what the point of the graph is, though like, if there was more time afterwards to explain it, I don't know. I'm not buying it.Okay, found the study. Yeah, just like I thought, there is tv and channels and radio, so this a hardcore, like a media response.Okay, let's take a look at the study, what does that say.Wait, but this went to another, another website, which doesn't, but see this, this isn't even the study, what they just linked me to.This just links me to another article on another website that I've never even heard of. The University of Southern Denmark, a bit of good news, but he doesn't have any, okay, so it says the paper is here, so what is that going to say? Um, I don't think this article means what these media people are thinking that it means. I'm not buying it. Nope. I'm going to put it back to a 1. Really not impressed with that one. Just about nothing, honestly. I wasn't impressed with this 'source.'First off, the website the article was found on was not a renowned media outlet in any way, and when I clicked on the link to the original article it sent me to another secondhand source instead. I had to look long and hard to get to the original source, and the original source did not look like it justified the way the Blaze was spinning it.Okay, so what makes this source more reliable to you, honestly, not really like anything, I didn't see much of anything to be impressed with in this source, I did not feel reliable at all to me, which is why I gave it a 1, and then what made it less reliable to me, that's a much longer list. Okay, the Washington Post, we are getting a little better here. This is something I have actually heard of. They, okay, this may sound a little bit weird, but I did used to study visual communication. This font just looks more professional, the layout of this article looks more reliable to me, it has captions for the video and the medium. What is a flight-proven rocket? Oh, so they launched, so it was the first time a launch had been reused. I'm believing this one a little bit more, it doesn't necessarily have to do, it's a current event, not necessarily a research study that needed to be debated on, and that feels a lot more reliable to me. I'm going to put this one at a 7 for now, and then I'm going to look up the, what was it called, the Falcon 9. Space.com, that's pretty good. Okay, so first reused one, so that, there are many articles that a google search is bringing up that says exactly the same thing, that this is the first reused rocket, and that SpaceX was able to do that, good for them. And it's the Washington Post, and it has specific times. The launch was specifically at 6:27pm, and that is a lot more good to me. Here it is, I've found it. I mean it has a lot of, kind of journalistic flair, a lot of word choice that I think isn't completely necessary in terms of research, but it sounds good, and they are reporters, so that is something that makes it slightly less reliable to me. More reliable: It's a recognizable newspaper, further research showed that this event did, in fact, happen. They used specific times and dates, as well as statistics. They had videos to prove the event and give further detail.Less reliable: You can tell it is a news article since some of the word choice is a little unnecessary.The only word that I can really think of is flowery, unnecessary. That's what I'll say. There are a lot more qualities that made it relatable to me. Statistics, which is always good. I thought that this is probably the best one that I can say I've seen so far. Okay, what is this one?  So that definitely doesn't sound like a sophisticated title. I can definitely see this happening, just because there are, I know that there are generations, where, the baby boomers, there were a ton of them, and they're all getting around that age now, they're all getting more elderly, so I can see that happening. I would not say there is a high amount of reliability based on the source website or the source reporter. Once again, no credentials whatsoever. This is something that is just kind of more based on common sense, something that I kind of believe.Yeah, that's not a very good wage per hour at hour at all, I almost get that. There's some statistics, though, they definitely did their research as far as this is actually true, as long as this is true, but I feel like this is good, they've got direct quotes. They've got some stuff going for it. Not quite as good as the other one, I would say, maybe, I just really do prefer actual research studies. Although this is also more of a current event type of thing, so I think that I'm actually going to put a 7 for this one as well. Current events are easier to find research for. I'm going to look up this article. What's it called.Okay, so first thing that pops up. An ad immediately pops up. I don't like that, but that's okay. It's becoming harder I'm going to see what link this takes me to. So we're back to the Washington Post, not quite as good as an actual researcher; however, this is something I trust a little more.They are leaning on the Washington Post a lot, I actually saw a lot about this article. Is this a spinoff of the Washington Post, is that what this is? I don't think so. Maybe they're just taking stuff from it. That's okay. They are relying, One of their sources is fairly trustworthy newspaper, and they use specific facts and statistics, and they link their sources so we can check it out for ourselves.The don't vary their sources very much. They're taking the Washington Post's word entirely as law, basically.I think reputable is the word I'm looking for, a trustworthy, as much as, as trustworthy as a newspaper can be. That's good. So I'm going to keep it at a 7, well I'm going to run it down to a 6. Yeah. Okay, so that was the last one.
