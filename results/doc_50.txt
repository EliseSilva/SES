Okay, well the first problem with this source is that it comes from NPR. (laughs). Which is a notoriously left-leaning news outlet. Then it says , so they don't give any specific name as to who this leading group was. It's just super unspecific; there's no reason given, really. Whatever follows isn't really it isn't really encompassing. I'd have to look it up real quick. Let's go All right, well, their sources seemed to check out, and there's nothing that implies that they have been dishonest in their sources. However, they do not provide any sort of counter-argument to what they are saying, so it very well could be that the majority of gynecologists and obstetricians do not agree with this statement. Leading group is a very vague term. And all of the sentences that they use to back up their arguments are very loose; it says there is a growing body of evidence that the safety risks are low and benefits are large so I don't really even know what that means. So I'm going to put this as a 6, just because the groups they cite aren't specific, there is no counter-argument presented, and all their references for the most part are just lame. Oh, whoops! Well, I already did that. Well, whoops. We'll leave it at a 6. If you were to say my first impression, I would have put it at a 4 and a half. And 6 would have been my second one. The fact that they could cite valid doctors in some cases that had their same opinion. The general use of unspecific information like  'a growing body  of evidence' and 'the nation's leading group of obstetricians and gynecologists.', etc.I know it's a blog. It's gonna be an opinion editorial, probably. So it's written by Paula Wallace, who is the President and Founder of Savannah College and Art of Design. Seems pretty credible. Let's see if you have the same thing (the before and after review rankings), yep you do. Okay. Let's see if there are tons of ads. When there are tons of ads, maybe it's just as credible, I just don't like it a lot more. Okay. CNN's Fareed Zakaria. I don't know anything about his credentials, but I do know that I disagree with him a lot. Well. Automatically biased. Maybe I'm assuming things, but most people that participate in the arts, especially to the extent that she does, are quite leaning to the left. Okay, that's a bad argument. Let's see if it gets better. So still, there are no I mean, in terms of her liability, there's really nothing I can say about it, it's just her opinion she's giving. She hasn't said any facts. She's the president of  I guess I could check on that, but I don't really feel like it's necessary. So she's just making an argument here. I don't know if she necessarily needs to cite anything let me see if there are more facts down here. Okay, cool. I can't really check her on any of the facts. So okay, there's one thing that could In terms of its reliability, I don't see any reason why it to not have it be a 10, because it's just her opinion, it's not like she's reporting news, it's from what seems to be a supposedly reliable source. She's the president of an art college, now I guess I can look that up. Paula Wallace, she is indeed president and co-founder of the college she said she was, okay cool. So Huffington Post I know there's a part of it that's a blog and there's a part of it that's not. So this one, saying she's just a president, she's not a validated reporter for a um I do not have time to read all this. I guess I could scrutinize it and see if any of the stats are presented in a misleading way, but I don't have any time to do that. So we're just going to give it the benefit of the doubt here. There are lots of ads, it's really annoying. Why Higher Ed and Business Need to Work Together, by Michael King, he's from Harvard, that means he's a pretty smart guy. Is he? Is he from Harvard? I guess I could look it up Okay, yeah, whatever. I would still read it the same. There is no change in my score. The fact that there are really very few sources cited and it is an op-ed. It doesn't necessarily need to cite anything in order to make it reliable because it is all her opinion. Read what it says above. Sorry, it's just I don't know if there's necessarily a way to consider this more reliable or less reliable. The only way that would have made it unreliable is if the study she put in here was not reliable, and also the terms successes and opinionated weren't anyway. Then significant curricular improvements yeah that's just another, you could argue it's not an opinion, could be a lot of extreme factors in that aren't just what they're arguing for but I don't have time to read that. Study finds melting sea is is actually helping Arctic animals. Okay, the Blaze. That's Canadian-based; isn't it? No, it's not. That's the one with Tom Hilleren ?. The blond girl who got fired for being too much of a diva. Okay, so first problem with this is. Justin Hashkins. I have no idea who that is. Melting sea ice is actually helping arctic animals. Well, duh. Okay, maybe I'll just read. First off, with the global warming debate, there is no definite science, despite what Bill Nye would say, a mechanical engineer who's not even considered to be a scientist would say Would not be able to thrive. Higher global temperatures. Studies. Findings. It's just a stupid argument, because, why is this a dumb argument I know why let me just thing. It's just a dumb argument because temporarily right now these animals may have a better life right now, it's about how the ice caps are melting and that one day the animals that are dependent upon the colder weather will not be able to survive because yeah, because their ecosystem is under threat right now. Okay, cool, you've got one study. Can't really ask for more. Wow. Okay. This is climate change. Climate change is accompanies. That is some great editing. Please take two minutesSo I'm going to rate this a 5, on about how reliable it is. Because I can't say anything about the sources that they provide or anything, but the argument is intentionally misleading. It says global warming fail: study finds melting sea ice is actually helping Arctic animals. So it's to make the reader think that what they're reading is a good thing. It should say: global warming is actually helping Arctic animals. The Blaze is notoriously right-wing, audaciously so, they are to push the idea that global warming does not exist. Okay, sorry that was a bad search. An inconvenient finding. That's true for some things, it's a very balanced ecosystem, it's just a dumb claim. I don't want Who did their research? Sorry, okay. The University of Southern Denmark. All right, Anthony Watts. Probably taking way too long on this. I'll speed it up. Okay, so they cited the same source twice  okay, I don't care. That's fine. That's kind of funny though, USA today, I don't know about their political views, but they are definitely not using the information in the way that it was intended to be used. Okay okay if you keep reading it does, not the little snippet you gave me, but that's fine. Again, their sources check out. I assumed they would, well some people just lie, I can put it at a 7, no, I don't' agree”it's not about agreeing, ugh. The fact that their sources check out makes this article more reliable. The fact that their headline is genuinely misleading and paints global warming as a good thing makes this article less reliable. It's just the fact that they have an agenda that doesn't make sense, that is intended to deceive. Washington Post, okay, this one is definitely left-leaning. Supposedly. Let's see what it says. Elon Musk's SpaceX makes history by launching a 'flight-proven' rocket. What is X? What? Near bull's-eye precision. Huh. Okay, so it just seems like a report. If I remember correctly, the Washington Post is a left-leaning news outlet, there's nothing really here regardless, it's a fairly reliable actually, was this in the middle? I can't remember, I can't remember I think if it leans somewhere it leans left of the political spectrum, but there's really no evidence to suggest to me that what they're saying is false, I they definitely inject their opinion into it, but there's nothing in the margins that suggests it's unreliable. Well, we're just going to rate it a 10 again. They don't necessarily need to cite their sources because it's a news outlet, so they have the right to I suppose, they interviewed these people and asked them about how the (yawning, inaudible) so it's just. The fact that it is based almost strictly off of reporting journalism signals to me that they don't really need any sources. Nothing to be honest.I don't know, maybe the fact that it was The Washington Post, but we have to move on. There's a growing crisis. The Daily Kos. I'm not familiar with that one. Oh, and it's a jobs crisis too, okay cool. Laura Clawson. (inaudible) All right it's under labor. Okay. Well, definitely left-leaning. Nazi frog (reading side bar) Okay let's read the actual article. Okay, so it's a blog. Maybe. All right, so a blog. That automatically means that this person okay, no credentials. Okay, maybe she was a nurse or maybe did a google search real quickly and got that statistic. Okay. This seems from Medicaid, nursing homes, okay cool. For the bind. Huh. That's why Medicaid is bad. What? That's pretty weird. All right. Republicans are standing in the way of adequate funding. Oh yes, of course. Because Medicaid is the only option. Ah, boy. First off, super biased. Second off, looks like it's a blog. She has no credentials here, it looks like it's just something that some person put, so there's no reliability. She cites a lot of uses a lot of emotionally-charged language. It's getting much, much, much more difficult from somebody that's paralyzed. Hm. As for her reliability, just based off of this, I'll give her a 7, because she does argue her point, and she does cite some sources, one survey discovered now when I check these sources that will probably come down because, well I just need more information.Well, Melania Trump thinks we're stupid; I'm knocking it down just for that. opens new tab, searches daily kos there's a growing crisis in careLet's see what the comments say.I don't know what that means. Okay, yeah, and also, this is the problem with Medicaid. Sorry, that's not important right now. This is why capitalism works, if you want people to work for you, you have to pay them a lot. Okay, let's see if they interpreted that correctly. Basically, she just copied the issue from this article. Oh boy. I do not have time to read all of this. Well, it's good for them. It means I can't know. Is there any information about the survey? Okay, so first off, it's obviously biased in the fact that it wants people to become All right, we don't have time for this. I don't necessarily think that those sources are unbiased, well okay, the Bureau of Labor Statistics one was pretty good, I just couldn't interpret it, I don't know about the Washington Post's interpretation of it, seeing as we don't have time, I'm just going to rate it a 7. Yeah, a 7, sure. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics validate the source more.Solely the fact that it is a blog that is very left-leaning and obviously is biased in its reporting.  Also Well, that's about it. Solely the fact that it is a blog that is very left-leaning and obviously is biased in its reporting.
