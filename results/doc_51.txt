Oh my gosh. Continues to read the article quietly out loud. First thing, I don't know what obstetricians and gynecologists are. So I am going to go look up those words to see what they actually mean. I wish I could copy and paste but it looks like it is not going to let me.So I guess that checks out. We wrote about it an everything. That looks very suspect. I am not saying I think that's stupid right there.So next I would look up this lady Krishna Upadhya, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a lead author of the review. I guess she is a real person. Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, there you go. So if this person is a real person, then that still doesn't mean that it is a true article, but parts of it are true. But then again I wouldn't trust it that much.It's NPR, so I would say a 7. NPR is pretty reliable.I got to look up one more thing. See, it's a real thing. Easily, lots of sources are there. That's not really the source, but I am just generally a skeptical person when it comes to online sources. Name brand, NPR is a nationally recognized radio station. If this article really is from NPR, it's probably true. Also, it gives credible names and sources.Overall, what qualities/attributes make this source less reliable to you? he types: Unclear motive and my general skepticism. Huffpost “ I am not sure if that's the Huffington Post from Philadelphia or wherever that is. I would say this article also has high reliability because of the name and also the general principles talked about are probably true. But I am going to look stuff up. Yeah, it's the Huffington Post.So I am just looking through these links to see if there are things that would discredit her. I am not really seeing anything. She is the president and founder of this college. She seems like a great lady. I wouldn't see any reason for her to be disbelieved. Plus, this is just her opinion. She is literally just trying to promote her own ideas and she is doing a pretty good job. But it doesn't mean that people have to believe her. I would also look up this advisory boards for law schools fact.I would say this has pretty high reliability. Writer is reliable and recognized. The website is also reliable.Honestly I am not sure. I don't see how I could find out if she wrote this or not. If the Huffington Post said she wrote it, then she probably did. I am not really seeing anything in the article that immediately discredits it. The Blaze. Okay, I don't know this website. Global warming fail: Study finds melting sea ice is actually helping Arctic animals. Sure (sarcasm). I have a lot of skepticism right here. Let's read and see what they have to say. So they are in Denmark? So I would look up that University pointing to the University of Southern Denmark. And why would Southern Denmark worry? Doesn't say which press release. I'd say low credibility. Now I am going to look up some things. The Blaze. It is a real paper, but I'll look it up just in case.  Okay, right there: unfiltered. Anyone can publish on the Blaze. It doesn't sound like they are too worried about the information they put out there. Next I'll look up the University of Southern Denmark. So right here it looks like it is a school of business and engineering and this is a biological study. It doesn't have that much to do with Arctic ice. Here is another thing - I don't know much about wildlife in Antarctica, but I would. Well I guess there are plenty of algae and bacteria in the Arctic. I guess what I can calling into question was the importance of algae and bacteria in the food cycle down there. So that kind of credits it for me a little bit. So I would put that somewhere in the middle. I'd have to do more research on that one. It's fairly credible but not super credible. Topic is easily researchable and there are a few outside sources to verify with. Reputation of the paper/website. Unknown author. Based on only one study from a business college.I don't know who that is. I didn't look them up. I would say this is a more reliable article. It's from the Washington Post. SpaceX is a real company. Just my initial thoughts.Looks like it really happened. I am also going to look at Elon Musk.Real guy. An investor. Stanford University. He is the CEO and CTO of SpaceX. Real guy. Washington Post, again, good reputation for solid news. SpaceX is a real company, easily researchable. Videos to prove it. not really sure.Honestly, I can't think of anything that would make it unreliable. Daily Kos. Hmm. Don't know that website.Just off the title, I would believe that, just from things that I've heard. I think that is true.You know what, I would look that up. I don't know if that's true. One survey discovered? Whenever I see that, I am not sure. I would look up that guy John Sauer a man quoted in the article. So it's against Republicans seems annoyed. The health system is already screwed up. I would believe this article, just because what I've heard from the radio and other people. The general circumstance of our health care is terrible. Maybe it's the Republicans' fault. Maybe it is everyone's fault. I would say this has a pretty high reliability, not too high though, just because I don't know some of these people involved.Daily Kos credibility? Ooo that is interesting.  Looks like this is a liberal paper. Printings that are against It is definitely a biased paper from a liberal perspective. Yeah, that discredits it quite a bit for me. Not completely, because there is a lot of truth to this, but it is biased for sure.I wish that I could look up this survey. I don't know who did it, where it came from. That is where this whole article is launched from. But I can look up John Sauer.Googles John Sauer. Looks at the results. It looks like this guy isn't super well known. Modifies the search to say John Sauer LeadingAge. Looks at results.So he is a real guy but not really well known. I am not sure what that say. I guess he is qualified to talk about this though. I would say credibility goes down just because it is a biased source. The general topic I am familiar with and believe that this is actually a problem.Unknown survey source. Clearly biased paper.
