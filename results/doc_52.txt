Yeah, I can't tell where it's from. So I'll just scan it and see if there are any sources. It looks like it cites a professor at a medical school. Um, it's somewhat reliable. I'll give it like, a 6. It would be nice if I can copy and paste this, but I can't. Oh, cause it's a picture. Okay, so I found the article online, and it's a .org, so it's somewhat reliable. But still it's not .edu or .gov. And there's a bunch of weird articles at the bottom which are probably clickbait, so I might actually bring that down to a 5. Quotes a medical professor, and it's a .org URL which is moderately reliable, at least more than .com. Could be .edu or .gov, doesn't have any sources sited from what I saw. Okay, so this is written by someone who is part of a college. Huff Post does not sound like a super reliable source. scans through article It seems like there are some well, never mind. Just looking for in-text citations. I don't see any. You can add them on snapchat, though, that's good. No works cited, don't know the URL so 5. rates article a 5. So this Huff Post, yeah, it's a .com, again a lot of clickbait at the bottom. Well, not necessarily clickbait, but there's a bunch of classy articles. Yeah, there's definitely some clickbait down here. So what I'm going to do is google HuffPost and see how reliable it is. So it's a liberal US news media so it's biased. So after that I'd probably rate it a 3.Cause as far as New York Times or something, cause even though it's biased, it can still be accurate. I don't know if it's just the HuffPost. .com URL, unfamiliar and unknown web page (at least for me), and there are no sources cited. It is also a biased web page with an opinion, but it's not a reputable news source. All of the catchy articles at the bottom could just be clickbait. not many.¬ùSo this is the Blaze, news. Once again, clickbait on the right. Which is basically articles that probably don't actually tell the stories of this maybe they do. Hard to tell. These are less of clickbait, more of just catchy articles, probably very opinionated, like this one seems to be. So it does quote the University of Southern Denmark. It shows some graphs. Says it's from NASA. Hmm. I'd give it probably a 4. Maybe a 5. I'll give it a 5. Again, there are all news articles, it seems like. And they're not from well-known news sources. Yeah, definitely some controversial articles connected to it. Which means it's probably not that reliable of a website, and they just want people to click on it to make money. So that will bring it down even more. I'll give it a 2. Quotes Denmark university and has a picture supposedly from Nasa (though these sources aren't cited). No cited sources. Click bate. .com. So this is from the Washington Post, so reasonably reliable news source. I don't see much of controversial articles, which is a good sign. And we know the author, I'm not sure if the other ones did. I'll give this one a 6. Wait, no, 6 up here. Yeah, the one thing that just makes this more reliable is the more well-known news source. Probably keep it the same. no sources cited, .com. Daily Kos. I don't know what that is. Doesn't seem to be like, very controversial topics, so I don't know if there would be any motivation to lie about it. Um. Some quotes. Some quotes in here that might make it a little more reliable. I'll give it a 5. Or a 6, how bout a 6. Okay, had a bit of a controversial pop-up. Um, man, it's got a long scroll bar. Lots of comments. Maybe I'll google the writer. Well, first I'll do the daily kos. It's just an internet forum. So everyone can contribute to it. Lemme search who the author is. She's kind of an eminent writer. She wrote for the New York Times. Well-known writer I guess. Yeah, it's not really reliable. : Not a real controversial issue. Forum. anyone can write in it, .com, no sources.
