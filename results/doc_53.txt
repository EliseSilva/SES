Well it is NPR so that feels fairly trustable. Okay so I am a little bit skeptical of that. I am reading this right now referring to the bulleted information listed in Google. That's interesting. It kind of makes it look safe or like a good idea.I mean, according to the research and these articles it looks like this would be fairly okay. But I don't know. Based on my feelings, I am skeptical of it. So I'd probably rate it at a fairly low reliability even though I can't really I mean if I was a person just looking at this that is what I would say. If I was just your average joe, I would probably rate it as a four. That it is an NPR article, the research I did on the web didn't oppose it. My personal feelings. I know that's not really a citable or logical source but that's the way I feel and that's how people tend to make decisions in the real world, I think. I don't find this one particularly unreliable or reliable. I don't feel like it has got an agenda it's pushing quite as much as the other one. Yeah it does, but I think it is all kind of logical, really. I feel like its like rating the dependability on an article that is talking about how people need to eat. We'll just put it as an 8. I'd say it's fairly obvious at least to me. I guess it is an opinion. Yeah, I guess it is an article that seems to be arguing an opinion rather than presenting what it says it thinks are facts. So dependability that depends on what your opinion is really. I am not sure what to look for here, because I already have my opinion. Yeah, I just gonna. Sorry, I just don't know how to enrich my answer based on other research for this one. The opinion seems valid. I feel that it is an article addressing an opinion, therefore, its credibility depends on your opinion. Global Warming Fail! Here we go. That's a new one.Oh! That is a lot of ice lost. Wow, that is actually a lot. Interesting. This little graph says the source is NASA's Grace satellites. That seems fairly reliable. Well, except that it isn't really addressing that article's main point.  A new article from researchers at the University of Southern Denmark. Well I am going to look up what that new study is and see if I can find some more information on that.Well I don't really know what The Blaze is. I need background on that. Based on this article it seems fairly credible. I tend to take any sort of political media with a grain of salt anyway, but I am kind going between 4 and 5 on this one. We will go with 4 because I don't know what The Blaze is yet, but I'll do some looking on that and see what I think.: Watts Up With That? The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change. Most viewed does not mean most correct. Little bit opinionated there, but Hey look! We are at the paper itself. I guess it was a legitimate paper that was done. I feel like the article is basically based on the credibility of the study, so you know. Sure, I'm going to go with a 6, which is pretty good for me. It is based on a real study, the study can be traced. When you look at the source this article was written from, it does use some opinionated language (I can hear sea ice fanatic heads exploding already. The Washington Post. Wow, these words are really small. Hmm, they're using rockets. Hmm cool. Well I mean, I'd say it's pretty credible, because it is not really a very politically charged issue. The opinion spectrum on it is going to be a lot less than say global warming or birth control. But I'll go ahead and do some research on it just for kicks. Elon Musk. Hmm It is hard to say how real a video is. Especially this part here what is that? What is that big thing there? That one looks a lot more real.This one's in Russian! Okay it looks like they have the same footage here as the other one. That's interesting. Yeah, I mean yeah. Cool. It looks fairly credible for me. I don't know the landing footage didn't look super real. Again, it is not like the most politically charged topic ever, so I am not overly skeptical of it. I'll give it a 7. It's not a very politically-charged topic, so I see less motivation to fabricate an article or less likelihood of inaccurately presenting the information based on opinion.I looked up the video of the landing and it didn't look super hard to fake. Flips over to the last article and begins reading.Daily KOS. I don't know that. Looks like they have Republicans and Democrats in that region up there. Maybe some impartiality bias there. Sorry these are distracting here. Whenever someone starts calling out a party like that, I find it less credible. Because you can see the opinions really start to influence the article. Plus, I don't really see the logic here: increasing funding would help protect people's heath, it would create good jobs, and it would keep elderly and disabled people from having to come to nursing homes. I don't really understand that. Wait, are there any sources based on one survey discovered. Okay, we will go look at that. Yeah when I see this, that really lower credibility in my opinion. Plus, all this junk on the side as well and all the stuff down here referring to advertisements. When I see that on a website, it makes me a lot less trusting of it, just because it has all these little scams or whatever. What is the survey? A workforce report. Okay, this doesn't look like a study. It looks like a brochure. Looks like I had better finish up. There is a study cited.The study seemed like a brochure more than a study. Also the site didn't look super reliable to me (when I see the F word my sense of professionalism decreases drastically).
