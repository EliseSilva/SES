Because. So, for this I first look and see who it's by. It's npr, which is a relia--. Well, somewhat a reliable news source. It could be biased because it isn't, it's a radio show. It could be leaning more towards either democrat or republican. They try to be neutral but they usually lean towards one side. So how I would go about it is open a new tab. And search NPR. So they are a dot-org. So that does make them a little more reliable even though they're a radio station. And you can go to, and see if you like it. Scroll down to the very bottom of the page. So it's got a copyright. You can contact them. They have sponsors. has a .org instead of .com. radio station. Public. Where it is based (state)That in turn leads to its credibility because depending on the type of research you're doing you might want to use that type of radio source. Radio bias. less likely to be neutral. Other sides.So if you look it says NPR, it looks like it says NPR Utah. So if you think about that, which I'm trying to remember. I listen to NPR sometimes cause they are a pretty good news station, and when it's based in Utah it gives you the feeling it's more conservative. But it might not be. I'd have to read the article. Okay. Please take two minutes to evaluate the screen shots of this article. On a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being low and 10 being high, how would you rate this article's reliability? Okay well, it's Huffpost. I'm pretty sure Huffington, I'm trying to remember. Well they look like they're also news. The copyright. It was updated. You can share it. So if it's news, the reliability should be high. Let's look at huffpost. So this is a dot-com. Trump-care flatlines with voters. They've got this lady that's on NPR. And also one common thing is most media is liberal based. This one looks more like maybe a bashing kind of site. Is it where they kind of maybe make fun of people. So it looks like it has high, like a decent amount of reliability. Give it a 5 also. But, it is a dot-com. And it is liberal. So it makes it less reliable. Liars. Ha. Media is controlled by the left, so reliability is low for things like this. Oh. That's more like it. Dot-com. Liberal. Liberals control the media. Leftist agenda.: it is news. In articles, essays, or other papers it is important to have both sides of the spectrum. Both extremes. : .com. liberal. Liberals control the media. Leftist agenda. Biased or not, the point of media is to sway.I'm just gonna copy and paste. Point of news. Point of media actually. Media is to sway.Give this a five. The Blaze.: If I initially agreed with the idea. Additionally sic research. Prior knowledge. I think the Blaze is republican. Isn't that Walsh write for the the Blaze? I think he does. Let's look it up. Matt Walsh. Is that how you spell it? Yes. It does. Yeah, this one was good. But I think he actually. I think, let's see. I like Matt Walsh.  So one way I go about checking if something is reliable is looking up the author of the paper. And I feel like this is reliable because I have a friend back home whose dad is a chemist, and he teaches at a UC school, California. And he's done studies that I've looked at as well.Like this. You've got a chart. You've got a picture. Got an article. You have a reputable source, who I previously knew something about, and where you can find both things, which are republican, but also things you might feel are liberal, but also they give a little of both sides it looks like, just from first looks. So that feels a little more reputable, and after doing a little more research, everything becomes like I can really trust this site.: knowing political standpoint (obviously leans one way). Straying from topic. So let's see. This is the Washington post. Probably liberal, coming from Washington. If you google it, you get lots of different things. Lots of different newscasters here. The Washington post has been reputable. Media by the left is considered fake news. So, I don't know how reputable anymore this is, I'd say this is more like a four. But, also,I get like a six because this article doesn't feel political. They're explaining more, what's happening in the world. Which is like nice. But like the overall source would be more like a five because it's the Washington post. So what qualities/attributes make this source more reliable? More reliable, well. Authentic topic. The non political feel of the topic. I kind of feel like giving kudos to whoever did this. Kudos, props to scientists, science but not mentioning religion. I dunno, this article might mention religion, it might not. The Washington post might bring up things about religion, it might not. But if they don't it makes it more reliable, unless they're using like sources. And then they're citing other things and whatnot.: authentic topic. Non-political feel of the topic. Props to science but not mentioning religion. Author of the source (big name). Forcing agendasWell it's like the opposite of what makes it reliable Stuff like that. Daily Kos. I've not heard of this one. Daily Kos.Also, I'm from California, so it feels like a lot of these I haven't heard of. Well, not a lot. I haven't heard of this one. Daily Kos. Here's why you won't see all those humiliating Gop town halls this recess after the health care bill. Okay so we got Trumpcare, healthcare, Trump, AHCA, Affordable Care Act, Republicans, Donald Trump, Obamacare, community, democrats, politics, GOP elections. That's pretty diverse. I mean they have a little more republican stuff than democrat stuff but that's also because we have a republican president right now. But they are not disproving, they are not avoiding the topic. So if we click on an Obamacare hashtag. Let's see. So we can look at a bunch of articles. It looks like they have both. They got copyright with Kos Media but you're allowed to use their stuff. You just have to cite them. This looks more reputable than what I've seen, so I'll give that an eight. This. Just kidding. This one looks. This one has, look, Republicans, Democrats, Science, Elections, Politics, Environment, Media, Obamacare, Immigration. So that looks like it's got a lot of different types of stuff. And then it's got pictures of an  elderly home. It's got tags on the side. It's got little stuff on this side. Comments. So yeah, I'll give it like a seven. And then when I do more research, I'll bring this back to an 8.: The unbiased tags (Hashtags). If the linked articles to tags are all one side. What? That's a lot shorter than I thought it was going to take.
