Well, there's no background, no evidence. They cited a couple research things that have been done, but they really didn't say where they got their research. I just don't think that it's, really a reliable source. They had one quote at the end, but they had no data, no statistics anywhere to really make it up? Well, they're a very liberal thing, and that's a known liberal stance, is a very pro-birth control, so it's instantly biased, which kind of makes me not trust them near as much just because they're already biased toward the topic and they don't provide very much. I want to see just where they got this research from. They have a few reliable sources. They have a quote from someone at John Hopkins University, and one hyperlink appears to be a reliable source, but I don't have a ton of time to go in depth and see how reliable it is. It is a liberal very biased company writing about a very liberal topic, making it extremely biased. There is also no numbers to back up all the claims they have made. Um, this one sounds a little less biased to me, but once again, I'm kind of a numbers person. There's no numbers, I feel like to say that they need these kinds of things, they need some kind of statistics. The logic makes sense, so I like the logic in it, but there's not really any numbers or statistics in it. The logic of this article made sense, and his claims did seem valid.¬ùLess Reliable:Although it did seem logical and made sense to me, I feel like once again there was no statistics or data to back up his claim. I've never even heard of the University of Southern Denmark. That's a warning sign right off the bat. Even if some species are thriving, what about the species that aren't? Here's a chart. I like charts.This sounds not very reliable to me. They've got this data in here, but this data doesn't back up their claim at all. The fact that when I googled it, it doesn't bring up anything like that, makes me think that it's not too great of a claim because nothing came up about it. So I'm going to have to say that this one's probably pretty unreliable. Well they have a pretty good chart in there. On here it says that not all their stories, are not always factually accurate. Well they have a pretty good chart in there. The chart does not back up there claim at all. The chart shows how low the ice levels are, and that really doesn't have all that much to do with their claim because they are talking about some species that do better when the ice melts but the didn't really address the idea of global warming at all. This source seemed reliable to me. Nothing really stood out to me as invalid. They didn't make any huge claims, and it had lots of information and data, as well as logic. I didn't really see anything that stuck out as not reliable, except for it has only successfully landed back on Earth once. If they're going to have ships that are constantly flying in and out, they need to be able to have them come back more often. However, he addressed this when he said that this was only the first time it had ever been done. Ten dollars an hour is more than minimum wage. That's a crappy job. I do like how they have numbers in here. I disagree with this one, on saying this is  It's interesting how they talk about the state of Wisconsin, when and this is a very liberal topic, when the conservatives actually won the state of Wisconsin in this last election. This source right here , they've got one survey, and it doesn't say where they got their survey. I don't have time, so I'm just going to go ahead and estimate without doing a search. She did have some statistics. She only had statistics for a huge controversial topic from one source from one state from one survey.
