Obstetricians, I don't even know what that is, but I definitely know what a gynecologist is. Oral contraception to be available without a prescription. I'll give a 7. I feel like I would have liked to see more numbers. I get where they're coming at, but it would nice to see percentages for stuff like that. All right, so, for I guess this would be the second question, I decided to put 8. I looked at their actual website, and then I went to Wikipedia. And then it seems like it's just a radio station that posts a lot of different stuff about a lot of different subjects. So I feel like it's relatively reliable, and that it's not going to put out stuff that would be untrue. That it is a national radio source and that many different people contribute. That these aren't just the opinions of one specific person but rather a consensus of sorts. I feel like in some of the articles not experts are talking and it is just commonplace people voicing an opinion without backing it up with statistics that support their claim.A Third Way for Universities. I like that point.  As sacrilegious as that latter question may sound to some, universities benefit from inviting professionals outside the academy into our department to help us understand how best to prepare student to flourish in the work place. I feel like that's true. So yeah, I'm going to go ahead and put this article at a 6. I definitely feel like it is a one person, this Paula Wallace, talking about SCAD, or the Savannah College of Art and Design, and how she's describing how universities should be, so, that's um. I feel like she does a decent job, but I definitely feel like it's just explaining why everyone else needs to do stuff her way, and I don't know if I really appreciate that. I'll look this up. Yeah, I'm going to have to put this one at a 5. Just looking at their different tabs, and one of the voices, it says queer voices, and I don't know if that's right. So, I'm going to go ahead and knock them down for that. I also really didn't like how they have a snapchat. I don't know if any big newspaper necessarily needs to have that outlet since there are so many other social media options out there. But you know, to each his own. Maybe it make it more reliable. I liked how in the article they got the president of the mentioned university to speak.Less reliable: queer voices tab, SNAPCHAT, GIF's. I just didn't get a very serious vibe from this website. It seemed like someone could say a joke and that was good enough material to make an article on. The Blaze. Climate change is accompanies, that should be accompanied, so that's a typo, so I don't like that. I liked how they used an actual graph for the screenshot above and explained why global warming is beneficial with the melt ponds. The spelling error threw me off. I don't know if somebody just didn't spell check it or what but I don't believe something should be posted with a silly spelling error like that. Also other articles posted didn't seem that serious. I just read one about how a pineapple made it into a museum of art and I just don't think that really counts as something noteworthy. I like how every different subject had it's own tab so I wasn't seeing stuff that I didn't want to see. I also felt the above article was very informative to someone who had no previous knowledge of past events leading up to this one. Nothing really made this source less reliable for me. I think it is the best source so far. All right, daily kos, I've never heard of that. Seems very, appears to be very political. I can just see at the top, it says, republicans, democrats, elections, politics, Obamacare, immigration, so it's seems like it's very evolved around that sort of stuff. Oh, those are hashtags. I like that first paragraph, that makes sense; it talks about economics, which is something I'm studying right now. As people can get better jobs, they're going to stop doing the crappy ones. All right. All right, yeah, I looked at the website, it appears to be all rather political. I'm not someone who's incredibly politically inclined. So I'll just go ahead and put it at a 5. It might be reliable to for some. It might not. I personally would probably never use this website because it seems like something that I'm not really interested in. It's interesting cause at one point they quoted something someone had told one of the Washington Post reporters. I assume you could have gotten this same sort of article from the Washington Post, so I don't know why you would have come here, if you could have just gone to the Washington Post. The fact that they used the Washington post. Explained how other jobs made more money and how that creates a shortage of workers  for these health aide or nursing assistant jobs. I just feel it is a little too politically included and for people that don't eat and breath politics, that kind of stuff turns them away from this website.
