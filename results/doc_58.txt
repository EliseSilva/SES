This article is written by someone obviously at NPR, that's who does All Things Considered. As a general rule they tend to try to take the middle ground on most things so I expect this article will be particularly neutral. Based on this first page that's what I've seen. It has not cited references or things of that nature though I expect that to be at the end of the article. I'm going to check the year this came out, open a new tab and search for FDA rulings on contraceptive pills for adolescents. An article written on US food and drug administration on the .gov site, there's a part that talks about the FDA steps they took considering the switching of plan B level contraceptives which would be birth control pills which are used after sexual conduct and it states that 2003 such a committee met on the subject. And at the end of the article it states that the FDA has completed its review and stated that adequate data was not supported to say the young women were less safe than others. Basically says there was not enough data and the propositions given were not good enough. Based on that material, and the statement in the article there's no scientific rationale for limiting access I would say that this is slightly a. biased or b. is trying to push a specific view rather than just stating all of the facts. I would put its credibility somewhere around the range of 6. It wasn't wrong but it wasn't entirely (couldn't detect word)  In general attributes that make a source more reliable to me are The past history of a source or source type to give or relay accurate and as unbiased as possible information or history. The source takes a stand without specific and broad claims as to evidence. Or sources that seem to be presented as having no error. Because nothing is perfect and nothing is without error, and so to say that something is 100% is a lie, outside of the gospel. So before I read the article I would have given it roughly a 7,  after doing a little research I reduced it down to a 6. Okay, so it's written by president and founder of Savannah College of Art and Design. Art and design institutions are not known for their reliability and are more known for their general liberal views and wanting to push a particular social point rather than getting across facts, and they have a tendency to skew facts, much like the way you would paint a picture and use specific colors or designs, not necessarily the true accurate nature of something you are depicting. She's trying to sell her own university. When she says I am privileged to serve the president of a university that champions a third way. Instantly in my mind  that she is not fully considering either side but in fact just trying to sell her own side. I would not be surprised if later on in the article it would suggest looking into her university. Again she is using wording that is almost completely left to the artists, with flowing, sublime, marrying the practical into one unified balanced learning. She's asking questions, not giving answers, she has, towards the end of the article, finally stated in Harvard Business Review a suggestion. It was not a statistical nor a straight statement but was a suggestion, therefore it could have been a summary. Based on this overview I would give it a 3 in reliability. I'm not going to spend time doing online research simply because she has failed to identify key points therefore I have nothing to evaluate with vocational preparations versus liberal education because I have nowhere to go and nowhere to look because I don't know what her points are in terms of concrete things to look up. Her things are merely philosophical and are more based upon your own moral view. Other than her position as head of a smaller university, I have no reason to take her or her article at its word. Personal gain from winning argument, lack of specifics, too liberal of wording. It was too flowy, to fluffy.Okay, article is from The Blaze, I've heard a little bit about it, I don't know much more. It basically has news channels, my voice, and radio. It sounds like a very open source document. Justin Haskins, written 2017, it's recent. He's only talking about one study. He's quoting a lot which is good, because in terms of reliability of his reporting if he is honest with the fact that he is not paraphrasing but quoting exactly, then I have no reason to doubt the veracity of those comments. He uses an estimated chart but he shows where it's from, it's from NASA grey satellites. So based on that overview I would give this one study he's talking about almost a 9. Now, to check it, all I have to do is copy and paste study by the researchers of university of southern Denmark. Okay I found The Blaze article, it's quoted in several others.  Now I'm going to the actual site of the University of Southern Denmark.  Nope never mind that's a brochure So I'm going to arizonaenergy.org instead. Same picture. Same article. Science Times. Written by a different person a day later. Again he's quoting from The Blaze. Okay so after research, the fact that it all seems to be coming from more or less one source, in terms of everyone is quoting The Blaze Okay, here's a second article, Science Daily. Okay, supported, okay, so based on that and that it sources its materials directly from the University of Denmark I would again give it a 9. Clearly cited the origin of the information and used mostly direct report quotations. Did not quote nor indicate a possible differing opinion from a reliable source. Okay. It's on The Washington Post but originally from The Switch. It's written March 30, not sure if it's this year or not. So this article quotes about as much as its own telling. That's not necessarily bad, in terms of reliability. In general I feel this is a fairly reliable article, I'd put it at about 7.  Never mind it wasn't quite as reliable as I wanted it to be. Oh well, I'll use CBS News, not that I particularly trust it, but just to make sure things line up. This article is more detailed. The source is something roughly credible. Therefore after I review I would maintain the credibility is somewhere around 7. States the facts and the writer does not seem to take too much liberty with the important details. He doesn't seem to aggrandize too much. Source produced the article too soon after the event meaning many key details were not as yet available to him. Therefore there could very well be parts to it we don't understand. So it's on Daily Kos, not even one that I'm remotely familiar with. Seems to be a smaller newspaper, that doesn't mean it's not correct. She takes some liberties with saying people who would have taken them 2009-2010 cannot get better jobs without explaining why that is just making the assumption that's correct. She's making statements, she's not identifying sources except for a president of a company. She says that this man and others blame things, we just have to assume they do without looking deep into it. Towards the end it says But to Republicans making America great again does not involve protecting women's health. So she has not destroyed her entire credibility but at this point I can only trust what she has quoted directly so I have to drop this down to a 4. While I'm sure that her facts are correct in terms of the reliability I just would never be able to use this article on its own, I would have to back it up, which I will attempt to do very quickly. It's a .org site, doesn't necessarily mean it's true, written by a doctor. The problem is I'm not finding very reputable sources but the problem may be this simply isn't a great thing to cover. So I'm going to have to go with 4.5. Direct quotes, morally sound reasoning. Until at the end when she blames it all on the Republican Party. Does not identify sources immediately, makes a direct political blame game at the end.
