Do I have to read all of it? John Hopkins, that's a winner, I trust anything she says.hm that's kind of a weird contradiction. The first thing I want to figure out is, what are the risks of birth control pills?  Bodyecology.com that seems alright. The first thing that I thought when I found that out was that this guy is pointing out why this needs to be a prescription drug because it has real health effects and if they're just passing it out like candy people won't realize how bad or how bad it can be for you. I guess they haven't really said any stats on this page, or at least I haven't noticed them. Citing a doctor from John Hopkins. Also it's NPR, I trust NPR. Probably because my mom listened to them every morning. And they try hard to be central. my grandpa when he had cancer, he went to John Hopkins and they were pretty good. And I've heard good things about them from Medical Schools. Also the lady is Indian, I have respect for Indians, they are pretty smart.And they actively try to be more mainstream even though they're pretty left wing. The fact that its Oregon and California. They are kind of extreme states in my mind. Also, I just don't trust them. And the East coast is better than the west coast. The fact that there were a lot of negative health effects that came up about birth control. I don't know I just kind of think of them (OR, CA) as more extreme. Also because, I don't know, I just don't trust them. And the east Coast is way better than the west coast. Also the fact that I just researched it and with just one google search it came up with tons of health risks and this article said nothing about those. I don't know, It seems a little biased to me. It seemed like the article didn't even care about the negative side effects and they weren't going to even to like address that there's a negative side. Hm, that seems a little sketchy. Yeah so it seems like they are ignoring that side. And if they wanted to be a reliable article they would at least bring up that side. I guess I'm Generation Z, my dad told me that the other day, so I seem to relate.  I guess I'm not that super extremist, everyone should be well rounded, it's good to have career choice or career directionOH Harvard Business Review, that's a credible source there. That make me believe the articleIs this NPR too, nah it's the Huff Post, I thought it was satire, Let me look it up. Satire blogs, politics, business, entertainment. So is it like, the onion?  Oh wow they won a Pulitzer Prize. I can't tell if it's like real or satireYep, they're definitely liberal.Even though they're a super liberal site they were talking about marrying the intellectual and practical, so that's pretty good. They're not just saying we should just teach kids about how to read Shakespeare. I don't know it seems pretty serious. Oh there's an add for John Hopkins, I don't think that has anything to do with it. the fact that they are a liberal news company but yet they tried to show a pretty centralist approach to education. Also when I looked them up they seemed VERY liberal. Mentioning Steve Jobs.The fact that it said on Wikipedia that it's a satire. I'm not super sure what that means 100% but it made me question whether this was real or not.Ok so that's about it, just trying to move fast so I kind of just scanned it. Steve Jobs, I mean he's cool but he didn't complete college he dropped out so, well I still respect the man.  Mentioning Steve jobs proves reliable. My bull crap meter is like already going off. I know we're wrecking this planet, I went to China. What company is this? Blaze? Oh my gosh I hate their name too. This article gets me triggered already. Stated the press release, hm, so it's just this one guy. Climate change is accompanies? Are you for real, that doesn't sound like it's proper English. They need to change that to a d, oh my gosh do they not even have an editor for this company? This article looks like it only has one source for why this thing is good. Also they don't even likeI found a type and I hate their argument. They seem so biased it kind of makes me angry. Even Global warming fail? Are they in middle school, also they didn't even capitalize it. I think they should have capitalized that. I want to look up the real thing. USA today  that it's terryfing. That's it, that's all you got? 1817? Are you stupid? Who cites something from 1817? Especially for a scientific article. Glen Beck, It's like that AM radio stuff. It's in Texas, I hate texas. Texas politics are stupid. Of course they'd be the ones to benefit from making it look like global warming doesn't matter, they have all the oil. Pretty much nothing. I guess it was a new viewpointI hate this article. What made it reliable? It didn't even have anything I guess the fact that it's the University of Southern Denmark. I've never even heard of that college before. The article was super far right. They didn't even address the other side. They had a typo, they cited a science report from 1817. It's a far right, radio based media from Texas, what is there to trust? They didn't provide numbers for increased health. I hate this source. It makes me angry just thinking about it. Yeah my roommate was super far right freshman year, I hate it when people are that close minded. They didn't provide numbers for. also my dad listened to Glen Beck and all that garbage when I was a kid, I mean I respect my dad but I never side with his thinking in politics. for increased health. Yeah that's about it. Wash post, I'd actually heard that before, my professor was talking about how much waste was lost in space. Bezos owns the Washington Post? Wait a second. Heythat's a little sketchy. Oh I guess it wasn't his but, that's not a problem then. He didn't own the company that did it I think. It sounds like his company was trying to do it so It was his buddy in the same field or something related to what he's passionate about also, got success, so that's not that much of a problem to me.  Seems like not very biased or anything, they're just reporting Space X, I'm going to look up Space X  Privately owned company. Hawthorn CA,  Is he English? Kingston Ontario, Is he Canadian?  South Africa, cool.  Establishing a human colony on Mars, Woah woah woah. Ah my man! This is a name to remember. Is he not the main tesla guy? These are the kind of people who like engineer, investor.not like the Rockefeller jerk philanthropist. Ah he lives in Bel Air, well I mean he's got a lot of money but like. 70.2 million, NICE  He's someone who's also trying to do other things. Is this different from the guy who my man from tesla, I like that guy, maybe it's the same guy. They're different. It's just reporting the details of success in scientific research. There's isn't too much to doubt. I guess they didn't say any negative thingsI guess they didn't really state any downfalls of that, but they don't' really need to in my opinion, they're just reporting what happened. Similar to a kid's graduation party they wouldn't just say really crappy things about what he did in high school. They're just saying his successes there's not much to doubt. I don't like these adds, these adds make me want to trust it less. Let me look up the crisis ---whatever I don't have time for that. New opinion. I've heard the opposite.
