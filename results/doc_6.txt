I mean, the title is always kind of hard, especially for studies that are related to health. You know, the first, I guess the last part of it, researchers say, that's always kind of misleading. It's kind of something to think about. I generally try not to look at these things. Based on anything except for facts. Yeah I mean, what I always do when I look at these, is go right to the studies they're sourcing. After taking a few science classes, especially, psychology, it's really easy to see how someone can take a study, and basically say, pretty, sometimes maybe the opposite of what is actually being said. So, I'd have to look at the study specifically and do kind of in depth research, but you know, I'd give it a 6, just because they actually are quoting studies, which a lot of articles don't do today. It's just based on feelings and just word of mouth. So at least it gives you the option, and that's kind of good cause it helps your credibility a little bit because they're relying on you to do that. The fact that it actually has links to the study and information cited. Also that they quote someone with credibility, even though it does not mean it is true. A little bit of the language they use-honestly I'm just skeptical of anything that is not direct research based on facts. I mean, reliability, it's kind of hard since this is like an op ed, like an opinion editorial. It's not really, I don't think it's necessarily reliable, I don't think it's necessarily unreliable. It's just someone's opinion of how things should work. Yeah, I have a hard time defining what is actually reliable for something like this. If it was just the sources he's quoting, I mean that's one thing, but the whole article in and of itself. I mean, it's kind of hard, but I probably say 9. I mean something that I also thought of, and may just be, there may not be any substance to it, but he doesn't really take a super strong position, kind of telling us that he's not, he won't have a lot of bias, but you know that could just be me, he could be completely biased, he's just writing well. For something like this, I kind of don't even want to do more research, cause it, I mean I could, it would just take too long, and it's not something, I don't think it's that important, um. I mean the other thing with doing research, that's kind of interesting, and I'm going to rate this as a 9 still, something that is you have to think about, or at least I think about while I'm looking at this, is the whole idea that I could go out and research something that could prove this wrong or be very strongly opposed to this, it's just another process of sorting even more information out. Well, As far as being less reliable, it's just kind of like, I mean it's kind of interesting what goes on in the mind, like I don't really care, and therefore I don't really want to go out and research this. But he wasn't really claiming anything huge. It does not seem very bias, at least in the way he wrote it, which possibly indicates he is being honest. His arguments are not extremely polarized. Honestly not much haha. A global warming one, perfect. I mean, this is actually something that I've researched a lot because it's a hot topic, it just is. And I think it's one of the prime examples of reliability. In this one, I don't think it's necessarily a question of reliability, it's a question of what they're saying and how they're interpreting it. Because you know, I could do the research right now, but there's an article that just came out that says that actually, arctic ice is increasing overall, but decreasing in certain peninsulas, giving it the appearance of melting a lot. And there's another study that says that that one's false, and it's very difficult. As far as being reliable. I wish there were two reliability measurements, one for factual evidence, and one for what this evidence actually means. Because I believe it's true that global warming will help arctic animals, but how much does it help them? Does it actually help humans overall? Stuff like this, it's just again, a more complicated process. I'd probably give it a 5. And I would do the research, but I've actually done this a lot, so I already did it, and yeah.Yeah, it's 6ish, just because, I'm not, no one can just be the NASA data, I mean you could just be the NASA data, even when they bring it out, there's been evidence that NASA has actually faked data and jumped to conclusions, so even then it's kind of hard. So I'd give it a 5. Quotes. Man I'm having a hard time. A less reliable, like I said, it isn't a big question of how you interpret the evidence and what it actually means. Something that's also interesting about this article, is that you'd think that maybe someone who believes that global warming is actually, well, okay, the title, Global Warming Fail, that's kind of the makes it a little bit iffy.More reliable: It quotes credible organizations and gives credible evidence.Less reliable: It is jumping to conclusions with the evidence and no actually answering what this means for the topic, or mankind. Okay, um, I mean, I would, I'd give this a 10 on reliability. Just because there's no, there's no bias really, it's just a report of something that happened.You know, I'm kind of curious, though, what happens when I kind of google it.Yeah, I mean it doesn't really seem controversial. It doesn't seem controversial at all, just kind of reports what's going on. And as far as credibility of this source, I mean, I'm having trouble thinking out loud.I mean when it comes to the credibility of the source, I don't really care, personally, because whether Donald Trump was the one who wrote it or an esteemed PhD NASA employee or just a journalist or it really doesn't matter, I just want to know if they're facts or not. But I guess the source, there is a little bit of bias.More reliable:  You know, they're claiming this is some great thing, you know, historic. Others could argue, yeah, it's cool, but it's not historic. Claiming that it's really historical, it's cool that this happened. You know, I'll give it a 9, because you never know really. This is essentially just a report of events, not subjective topics. The language of the article. But hardly enough to make a difference. All right. Well, what comes first, is obviously, the position that this person is taking, which is we need to fix this crisis, of hospices or aides not caring for elderly people, or having too few of them. You know it's good because they do have some surveys, honestly, this is like the least reliable one yet, because I think it's taking a problem that is extremely complex and boiling it down to Republicans getting in the way of adequate funding. And bias, everyone is biased, for me, I am more conservative in this sense, I don't think anybody should have to pay for anybody's health care, I don't think health care's a right. And so that's kind of how I look at this. As far as being credible, I don't think it's too credible because there's not enough fact. And the one quote that they do have by someone, this, you know it's, this one person saying I'll skip a mea. Just saying how it's a terrible thing. They're taking one person and acting like it's happening everywhere. You know, give me a survey of patients who are actually experiencing this, and then we can talk about it. You know, there are lots of ways to do this, but just not providing a good enough foundation. But on the other hand, they do quote some, you know, I guess accredited people. So I'd give it a 5. This is also kind of hard to do research, you know proper research for something you don't really care about. But as far as more reliable, I mean it.That's always a good sign, I look for numbers and facts when I do it. When I look for credibility. That's honestly it. Like that is seriously it. That's a lot of what I do.More reliable: It uses a study. A few lines are slipped in there which indicate there is bias. Some evidence they use is being too generalized.Just kind of how I looked at it. Yeah, facts, links to other sources, sources cited at the end of the article, and the way it's written, it makes you question, at least, in any case. So maybe, the way an article is written it may not be the direct reason as to why an article is not reliable, but it makes you question if these things they're saying are reliable. So then you can further evaluate sources they give. And if they give no sources, if they just say, a study said this, but they actually don't give the study, then I'm going to assume it's false. I need to know where that study is. How often do I check it. It depends on what it is. If it's something that I care about, and I think it's important, then I'll check it.But if I'm actually checking because I care, I basically do every source.
