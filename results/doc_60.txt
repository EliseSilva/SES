I've used and heard of this source. She then erases the whole line. It's a widely known source. The information in the article seems to be extracted from other reliable sources and is properly cited. The language has a tendency to be informal or even conversational, which can detract from the source's credibility, especially when presenting medical information. I've heard about the Huffington Post before and this article seems to be reliable, I guess. It is properly cited. All the sources are cited. But I feel like the ads on the side really detract from the overall source. And also, because I have heard of the Huffington Post before, I have preconceived notions about it. I've heard that it is not very reliable so I am going to do some research on it. I think there are some informative looking articles, like Jordan Edward's Father Sues Police Officer for Killing His Son, but then there are others that are phrased in informal language. To me personally, informal language or conversational language, when used on what is supposed to be a formal news site, kind of detracts from the overall credibility of the source. Trump's Weird Way of Pinning a Tweet is Freaking People Out in the politics section. I am a little bit They are talking about the way he pins a tweet and how it freaks people out. I guess it's a story, but I don't know if it is really important and if it belongs in the politics section of the news site. I've also heard that it can tend to be politically biased. When I go through sources for research papers, I prefer to use sources that don't have particular political leanings. They just present the news how it is, even though it is hard to find. If there is too overt of a political bias or something that they are trying to push in any site, I feel like it takes away from the credibility of the overall site. Again, the Huffington Post is a widely known news site. Informal and conversational language. Several articles about irrelevant stories. How Trump Pins His Tweets Freaking People Out. Too overt of political bias/leaning. I prefer to use sources that remain neutral or at least have a good mix of stories encompassing both left and right wing ideas. The number of adds on this page, adds are inevitable, but they take away from the credibility of the source. In my personal experience, sites that I've encountered that have lots of advertisements tend to be less reliable on average than sites that have less advertisements. Especially advertisements like bad news about met form in and finally! Hilary's vicious plan to overthrown Trump caught on video, things like that that are click-bait-y with sensational titles, it gives me a red flag. Because typically sites that have more of these types of advertisements, that make you want to click on them, tend to be less reliable. They tend to be more interested in profits than reliable news.The business insider has always been reliable, so I like to use this to determine the credibility of other sources. And again, I guess the Blaze has the same problem as the Huffington Post where it appears to have an overt bias towards one political side. It kind of detracts from the credibility because I feel like they are trying to promote their ideology rather than share the news in an unbiased way. Unlike the Huffington Post, the Blaze seems to be a lot less mainstream. It hasn't been heard of as much. Rates it a 6 (in between 6 and 7). It presents the news. It's less mainstream (which isn't a huge determining factor in evaluating the credibility of news sites, as there are mainstream news outlets that are majorly considered to be unreliable, but credibility, in part, can be responsible for how widely known the source is). Political bias/leaning towards one side. Presents the news in a way that supports political bias.A lot of the articles are written by one person, Sarah Taylor, and other person, Carlos Garcia. Sarah Taylor has a lot of articles on this site. That is another thing though that personally I find, not suspicious, that it indicates that it is not as reliable. If the same people are writing the same articles In this particular article, the Professor of Biology is cited as saying this quote from NASA and while the article itself goes against the mainstream point of view about global warming, the sources seem to be properly cited they aren't extracted from out of nowhere. A study from researchers at the University of Southern Denmark. I think it is alright. I can't be too sure, but I can't find any fault in how they are citing their sources and where they are taking their information from. But at the same time I know this entire news outlet is very politically biased and right wing views tend to be that global warming is it differs a lot from the liberal view point about global warming. This supports the right wing view and it is on this website that is skewed towards the right wing point of view. Also, while everything is properly extracted from reliable sources like NASA and professors of biology at the University of Denmark, it is still presenting information in a way that tries to support their politics. That makes the news site less reliable to me. So right off the bat, I have heard of the Washington Post. Not many adds or anything.  I would say a 7.5, just because again I have preconceived bias for the Washington Post. Honestly I have heard of this and have used it in the past and it has been majorly reliable. On the Business Insider Reliability Chart it indicates that on the whole it is pretty reliable. It is a more liberal news site. Not just the fact that I know the Washington Post, but also the way that the website is formatted and laid out. The unreliable websites tend to have lots of ads and pop up ads and those click bait ads everywhere they take up the majority of the page. But this website, the way it is laid out makes it so that there are advertisements on it, but they are not really the click bait type or the type that are obviously very questionable. These are proper advertisements, like an Allstate advertisement. I think that is the only advertisement on this page. And I like this site as well because overall it seems like the language used is appropriately formal and it is not like they are trying to get you to click on anything, the titles aren't too sensational. Site layout (less advertisements, and the advertisements themselves are not the clickbait types that out find on typically less reliable sites, such as tabloid sites). Articles use appropriately formal language. Is politically affiliated, but isn't overt about it . Nothing in particular stands out.And in this particular article on this page, everything seems to check out. It isn't presenting or framing this story in a way to support their political bias or anything. It is just a story about Elon Musk's SpaceX. Oh this I have heard of this, the Daily Kos. And again, it is inevitable, but the advertisements like easy fix for constipation and bloating and Melania Trump thinks we're stupid, those kind of advertisements that are promoted links that try and get you to click on them, those detract from the overall quality of the website, especially if it is a news site. It kind of bothers me when I am looking at news sources. Something like the Washington Post that doesn't do this makes me think it is more reliable and credible than a source like the Daily Kos.I don't know much about it though. I don't have any reason to really think that it is particularly unreliable in any way. So it is a political blogging website. And like, I'm not I don't know what to think about this, but I came across an article on the Daily Kos about how the Daily Kos is not a credible news source. And on the recommended list there is an article called Dear Kos, I'm not leaving. I guess it is a news site, it is like a news blog with lots of different authors writing. The fact that they allow this kind of article on here, I don't know what that indicates. I don't know what to think about this. But I do get the idea though that it is a compilation of different people with different ideas writing about different things. So I personally wouldn't use it as a site for news. After I researched it the reliability went down, because it seems to be a majorly opinionated source and I wouldn't use it as an objective news source.Rates is a 4. Somewhat well-known. Appears to be opinion-based. Clickbait advertisements. Political bias.
