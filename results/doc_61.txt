So this article looks fairly reliable. Just from glancing at it, I can see it looks like it comes from NPR which I know is a pretty reliable source. Under the subject of public health. And I've listened to All Things Considered before, and I really like their articles. I think. I would like to see if there's, if I was using this for a school project or for a research paper I would definitely have to look up Rebecca Hersher and maybe see what her qualifications are, and also find out what some of these sources, I know, for example, the Journal of Adolescent Health. That sounds pretty reliable, with quotes from a professor from John Hopkins School of Medicine. That seems pretty reliable too.So I would probably give this, just off of face value, I would say about a 7. If I did a little more research about the author and where these statistics came from, then I would probably give it a 10.  It doesn't really look like Rebecca has personal qualifications, talking about medical related activities. It kind of looks like she reports on all different types of things. It doesn't have any sources included, so I guess I could look up these quotations and statistics on my own, but not seeing it here kind of makes it an unreliable source for me. I wouldn't want to use it verbatim in my school work. I would probably give it about a 5. This sources at face value seems reliable because of the well-known name, clean appearance, and recognized names used throughout the article, (Johns Hopkins, Journal of Health, etc.).So overall I would think. Oh! I read this wrong. Oh. No. So I think this is reliable because it is a well-known name, the radio station. And I've listened to it before and I know the things I've heard are true. Overall it's a clean looking screenshot and article, and I recognize a lot of the names within it. So that's what makes it reliable to me. After looking with the additional browser, I saw online no bio of the author, (including her qualifications for writing this) as well as no sources included.So this was less reliable to me because there was no immediate information on the author. I didn't know her qualifications to be writing about birth control or really anything in the medical field. And there were no sources included or no citations, so it's hard to know if what she's actually sharing is true or made up. This website, I already kind of don't feel it's very reliable mostly because of its layout and the ads on the side. I don't know why but they kind of take away its seriousness to me. I guess contributor is probably the author. President and Founder of Savannah College of Arts and Design. I don't know if that means she wrote this or is part of it or owns it, I'm not sure. I am really confused when I look at it actually. I don't get these lines.I see that it looks like Well. It kinda looks like someone was just writing whatever they felt, or thought. It doesn't look like there's many statistics. I guess there's one right here. I wouldn't really feel this was very reliable, even, I feel like, if I looked it up later it wouldn't change. I'd probably give it a. Okay. Looking at it now. It looks the exact same. And the ads are different on the side. And it feels like this is more of a like a pop culture type of an article. Not a reliable source I would use in school work or in research papers. Seeing stuff like this doesn't make it look, or seem, very reliable to me. Still not sure if Paula is the author, and I can't tell if there's any other names.It kinda looks like this was just a personal article reading from her first person view. Which I guess her view probably isn't wrong I just don't know what I would need this for in school. This would need a citation and I don't see one. There's no sources. More weird ads. I definitely would not consider this a reliable source. Probably just a pleasurable read. I'll keep it at a 3 I guess. I'm not even sure what would make this reliable now, thinking about it. It looks like the author does have, has a connection with SCAD as a contributor. Author has a connection with SCAD, which makes her words more believable, she may actually know what she is talking about. So probably the only reliable source I can think of is that Paula Wallace works for SCAD and that seems like that's what this topic is about so she probably can give us some valuable input. But other than that there's nothing really that really makes it valuable to me as being reliable. The layout, pop-culture ads, and lack of annotations, biography, or sources makes this an unreliable source to me.So this one is less reliable because of its layout. A lot of the pop culture ads are distracting and not professional. I wouldn't want to use something that comes from a popular post or from a blog in an important work or research. There's no annotations, no biography of the writer, not even sure if she's the writer, and there's no sources that make this reliable. Okay I'm looking at this one. Kinda feel like it's the other one. I don't even know what's going on here.I'm guessing Justin Haskins wrote this. I don't know anything about him. And I'm really distracted by these ads that are also seemingly unrelated. Christian books and, this just kinda looks like rumors. This looks like a tabloid kind of a website. Let's see. A new study at Denmark. I'm assuming this is, this will take you to the source of this study. Wonder who the press release is, if they're reliable. Or if this is even still from the same source. This is important. It looks like that's reliable. The name of a professor and his location. And his relevance to the topic. Quoting NASA, a well-recognized group.Looks like they got this from NASA so it's probably a pretty reliable graph. I'd probably give this, a four? I think it's. Actually. Well on the surface level it's a lot more distracting than the last one. These things seem like they are just not real and they're so distracting and not professional. So it kinda gives the vibe that this webpage or source is not something I'd want to use in schoolwork. Probably just more for a pleasurable read again. But I feel like it does a better job with its citations and sources and then using a recognized name and graph gives it a little bit more reliability. I guess I'll look at it online. That's not it.Even the name of the website is just not particularly, catching for not the right purposes. Kinda more distracting actually. Let's see if this source is actually real, and where the source comes from. Oh. Okay this seems even weirder. This makes no sense. Reference pages. Submit stories. Okay this seems more like a blog.This doesn't look extremely reliable. So it looks like this is, well, the source. Polar Biology. I guess if I had more time I would go through this to double check if the quotes were all accurate. I kind of feel like I'm going on a wild goose chase because I can't really find out if this was reliable or not. This looks reliable. I definitely feel that. I'm not sure how current or correct this article is, that was quoted on the Blaze website. And who is Anthony? Not sure if I can trust him and his opinion. Overall, this is weird. I think USA today is a pretty reliable source. I've watched it as a news channel. I think. I think it's news. The ads are super distracting and I don't think they're very professional, cause they've got a lot of pop culture again. I'm not sure who wrote this. Nick Cardona. Not even. Okay. Great. I don't know anything about him. It looks like they're kind of quoting the same thing. Okay. The charts look nice, but I can't really well. Here you can see a source for this one. Nothing for that. Well. USA Today. They're getting from themselves. Contributing: Associated Press. I don't know if that means a lot of people contributed to this article and there's not just one author. And it looks like there's no sources listed, which is not good in my mind. Okay. So it looks like there just quoting a bunch of different places. Quoting USA Today again. This looks pretty reliable. I'm wondering really if this website is nice or not. Reference pages. It looks like they have a lot of information. Sources for all these graphs. That's good. I'd say this is pretty reliable, but the Blaze is just quoting it. Okay I would probably give this. At least I can find the sources. I would give it maybe a four or five. It is more reliable because sources are included in the web page, and most sources seemed reliable and authentic. Graphs, and respected names used throughout the source also gave it more credibility.So this source is reliable to me because in the webpage it had links to its sources, and for the most part the sources seemed okay. They definitely could have been a lot better, and more reliable, but at least they did have the sources included. The graph seemed to be authentic, from respected and well-known names, for example NASA, so that gave it a little bit more credibility to me. The web page doesn't seem reliable as to be speaking about this topic, the site seems more of a pleasurable read on many different topics, nothing I would use for research, more for enjoyment. No information on the author or works cited at the end made it less reliable. So this was less reliable to me because the webpage didn't seem professional in what its claim was. Talking about global warming. With the ads on the side it kinda makes it seem less professional, and more of like a blog site or a pop culture site. And also, a lack of information on the author and no works cited at the end made it also less reliable. So I see the Washington post. I'm pretty sure that's the newspaper. A well-known newspaper company. Here's the author Christian Davenport. Looks like you can click a link to hear about him. Ads aren't as awful. Just looking at it. Just glancing. And. Okay. I would probably give this a six.. So here is the real website. Christian Davenport the author. Here he is I guess. Looks like he talks a lot about space actually. All these topics seem to be related. He probably has, I dunno, some background in what he's talking about. But I can't see anything about him so that makes me a little wary. I don't know his qualifications to be writing this piece of rhetoric. I guess the video's nice. I guess its proof of whatever he's talking about. It looks very factual. As if he was there or he's done his research. Glancing at it, I'm not seeing any included sources. I'm not seeing any citations. He's quoting someone here. Not sure if he's quoting cause he was there or he found a source to get it from. He's quoting something from NASA, that seems pretty reliable. Oh. Here. Wow. That's awesome. Christian Davenport covers the defense and space industries for The Post's Financial desk. Okay. That is a lot better than all the other websites. Um, comments. It looks like they control things that are on here. This actually looks pretty reliable to me. A lot more than the others. I think looking at it makes me rely on it a little more. The source is from a well-known named newspaper company that I have heard and seen a lot in my life time. I assume that it is a reliable source if coming from Washington Post. Online, the post includes names, titles, and qualifications for those quoted in the paper. More information on the author, who seems credible and knowledgeable on this topic.So this source is reliable to me, more reliable than the other ones, because I trust the name of the company from where this post is coming from. Online in the article you can see, I guess the source had citations with the names of people who he was quoting and their relevance to this topic, for example their occupation. And then at the end it had more information on the author who was a credible source for this topic. And who had already been writing a lot more things about this. So it makes it a little more reliable to me, because I know who he is, and that he knows what he's talking about. I think things that make this less reliable. No references to sources.That there are no references to the sources which makes this a little less reliable in my mind. Okay. Daily Kos. I have never heard of this. It looks like it talks a lot about, I dunno. Everything. Laura Clawson. It looks like it's pretty recent. Here's a survey, and it looks like you can go to it. Looks like they're doing some quoting of people who are qualified to speak on this topic. Washington Post. You can probably find that source. Okay. Overall, I dunno, I'd say I give it at first glance like a six or a five. So Laura. Oh. This is great. Laura looks like she's pretty professional and knows what she's doing from the looks of it. Not sure what any of these things mean over here. At least I can know a little bit more about her. Looks like these are groups that she's part of. Okay, so diaries published. Maybe that means this is more of a blog, than I dunno, an official source. Looks like there's a bunch of other people. Well, followers. Looks like she does a lot of writing on, lots of topics. Lots of political topics. Hmm. Okay. It doesn't look like she has any official title or qualifications to be writing. Like it doesn't seem like she's in this field or profession. Maybe she's just a reporter. Let's see some of the sources. Oh yeah, the Washington Post. That's probably reliable. One survey discovered. Let's see what that is. This looks pretty legitimate. Talking about the statistics. This is probably what she quoted. Awesome. She returned to the article and scrolled to the bottom of it.Okay. So she's done her work definitely. And sourced everything which is nice. Sad that there is no sources included. There's comments. I would say this is pretty reliable. I think that I would give it about an eight. Seven or eight. Seven. Because I think it could be better. Popular writer, seems knowledgeable, sources included are legitimate, great following. So this source is reliable to me because, well it looks like she's obviously been writing for a while and people continue to follow her and comment and like what she's sharing. So she's obviously doing a good job or else they wouldn't follow her and the sources she used are pretty legitimate. This is less reliable because I see no qualifications to be addressing this topic, seems to be more of a blog or opinionated post. This is less reliable because I saw no qualifications for her to be talking about this topic. And it kinda seems like it's, I mean it mentioned diaries, so I feel like she's just kind of sharing her opinions. She was using facts, but I don't see why she's given authority to be talking about this topic.
