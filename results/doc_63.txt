Okay. Let's see. Well, the font looks official. Is this a dot com or a dot gov? But this also looks like the kind of article that would show up on a Facebook feed. Health news from NPR. Oh, this is NPR! Okay. We'll do 7. What second tab? Oh. Mmm. Kay. So I don't know actually a lot about NPR, I think its NPR. Look at that, it just shows up. Okay. NPR admits a liberal bias. NPR is liberal, but not very. Mmm. So, I already figured there was some sort of bias. That's why I put a 7. I wonder if you can do a 6.5. Huh. Well, we'll do a 6, just cause of bias. Overall what qualities would make this source more reliable? Well, it's a recognized name. Let's do that. From what I understand, a lot of people use it as a source. Recognized name. Used frequently as source. Some sort of recognized bias. Also it looks like an article that would show up on my Facebook feed. Again, this still kind of looks like something that would show up on my Facebook feed. All these advertisements. And I guess a lot of websites use advertisements. But look at this. 27 foods that can trigger migraines. This looks like at the bottom of those pages that show you like, that show you what child celebrities look like today. Um. The font looks pretty legit, though. Huff Post? I'm assuming that's the Huffington Post. But maybe they're trying to, I don't know we'll go with 7 again. Again, that's because I'm assuming there's some sort of bias there. Also, I guess I don't trust the media that much. Okay, so it is the same thing. Oh, look at this though! They have relevant issues that I face today! Like how Guardians of the Galaxy fits into the MCU. Okay, so it doesn't look like, so I guess this is just a newspaper, isn't it? Senator slams GOP Rep's Health Care Claims: what the F is that. Dove made bottles shaped like women's bodies, and it didn't go well. Cool, gutsy Sally Yates in the new queen of the twitterverse. I'm assuming that's talking about the person, not the drug. Sentenced to prison for fraud. So, yeah, pauses, okay. Lifestyle. Entertainment.  There's a lot of stuff going on here. I just don't like the news.Let's do it a 7. Yeah, let's keep it at a 7 probably. What makes this source more reliable to you? Recognizable name. Yeah, that's about it. I hear people source it often. Overall, what makes this source less reliable to you? I just don't trust the media. Recognized name. People source it, and seem to believe it is credible. I just put a lot of trust into the media. News in general is not reliable to me. Overall I would say it's credible because the majority of the world, or at least the country, seems to believe it's credible. What is this? Is this How Stuff Works? The Blaze. Never heard of it. We'll give this a 6, cause I've never heard of it, and it has all those weird advertisements. Like how to fix cracked feet. Some kind of weird memory. Bad News about Metformin. Yeah. This is, um, finally hilarious vicious plan to overthrow, yeah, these weird kind of Why do Amish keep this a secret, yeah that's a good reason. Lot of these weird additional articles. But it good font. Solid font. But constantly interrupted by ads, which means they probably don't make a lot of money from people reading their articles period, so they have to overcompensate with ads, and people probably don't use it. The Blaze. Condoleezza Rice. Chris Pratt apologizes to fans. So this seems really political. Oh, nope! Something about homeless people's hair getting. Rosie O'Donnell calls Trump Satan during speech, but she was just warming up she's a weirdo. Run for sheriff, ooh, retired NBA superstarAnnounced he's gonna run for sheriff, Shaq's gonna run for sheriff. That's cool. Huh. Shaq Daddy. I like Shaquille O'Neal. Rep. Raul Labrador won't seek re-election, run for governor. Glenn Beck reviews Guardians of the Galaxy sequel. Glenn Beck does reviews now. Oh, I didn't do this for the Huffington post. I guess this isn't really fair, but whatever. Well, I mean this isn't the best research, but nothing immediately appears. I still haven't ever really heard of it, so I'll keep it at a 6. What qualities make it more reliable the font. The font seemed credible. Whatever that means. Professional. Overall, what qualities make it less reliable never heard of it. Lots of ads. Ads is just one d, I think. The font seemed professional. Never heard of it. Lots of ads. I don't know why, but I tend to, I'm more okay with the Washington Post, so I'll give it an 8. More reliable to you. It was the newspaper I grew up with using. I grew up using. Oh! I know the Washington Post. Okay fine, I'll research it. Just for the sake of science. Yeah, this just seems like, I just assume most media tends to be a little bit liberal. Well, actually, this seems kind of conservative. Huh. Maybe I was wrong. Section about Sally Yates. She seems to be showing up a lot. I don't really know what she did or what she's about. Huh. So my initial thought was: media. Probably a little bit liberal. But, looking at these, it's just. And I mean it's Washington, come on. Okay so it says biased, here it says, liberal. Okay so it seems like a lot of these searches, granted, I recognize that this isn't the best research, but they seem to indicate that the Washington Post is liberal, and I guess that I'm biased too, just because this is the paper I always had to use for like school assignments, so illegible Washington Post makes it less reliable. That makes it less reliable. Just the fact that it just is media, the fact that it is media. It was the newspaper I grew up using. The fact that it is media.¬ùUm, makes it less reliable. But why is it reliable? Why? Let me look at it some more. It's just good. It's good stuff. I just trust it. Daily Kos. Never heard of it. So that's going to be a 6. All right, I should look at it more. Again, these weird what are these? Easy fixes for constipation and bloating. If you're getting medical advice from an advertisement or on the side of any article, that I don't know. That just seems kind of sketchy. Melania Trump thinks we're stupid. Pretty bold claims of a politician. So. Generally unbiased, No! I don't think it has anything to do with There's a growing crisis in care for disabled and elderly people. Oh, and it's a jobs crisis too. Okay, this is cool. Okay, Thank you Sally Yates. Woah, this is Orrin Hatch. Woah, this is interesting. Hatch on opposition to Trumpcare: 'Once you get them on the dole, they'll take every dime they can. Okay, so it says Orrin Hatch is running for re-election despite the fact that he's about 150 years old. Utahans. So. Sounds like this is pretty cool. This just seems really, um, informal. This just sorta feels like a blog. We'll take it down to a 5. What made it reliable? What made it reliable? The layout of the website and the graphic design seemed lookedlooks like it was done professionally. The layout of the website and the graphic design looks like it was done professionally. informal speech.
