Okay, so it's kind of looking like NPR is a radio station? Some kind of news. Let's Wikipedia it. Wikipedia knows everything, right? Yeah, National Public Radio, okay. I don't know, I just feel like usually media and things like that have kind of a reputation for changing peoples' word. Okay. Yeah. I don't know how much I trust that one. Just because that reputation that the media has in that way. Maybe. I don't know. I mean, I feel like once I read from it, I believed it and I wanted to do more research on it, so it kind of got my thoughts stimulating I guess. I'd probably give it a 5, this NPR article. Oh, I was supposed to rate it first. And then research it. Well, I'd still give it a 5. All good. Overall, what qualities and attributes make this source more reliable to you? Well, it uses some history. But I think. Uses history, but I think the main source of reliability here is the quote they use at the end from checks quote before typing this a professor from a well-known teaching hospital. Just that it's a media sight. I guess the difference between this one, I mean this one is from the HuffPost, and the last one like I'd never heard of, I've heard of the HuffPost before. I mean just looking over it. Okay I like that this kind of involves like, both sides of the story. Talks about millennials and generation Z, whatever. And then says, on the other hand, the cultural icons and thinkers, um, . . . this is interesting.  I don't know, I feel like this one is worded, like, more formally, I guess you could say. This takes more of a like, it sounds more diplomatic. That's what I'm looking for. Compared to the other one, which was more like something you'd hear on the radio. This is something that you'd honestly read. To learn more about it, instead of just to hear the inside scoop. So let's see. HuffPost. So already, this is fitting, because this looks like a very political site. And honestly, just some more national news. The other one, the other site seemed something like would cover giraffe's birth at the zoo, or whatever, and this takes more a stance on a national level. But I can't tell, I honestly don't know, if the Huffington Post is more of a liberal or conservative site. But it kind of looks like it's more of a Republican side. Ye-verest. Kanye everywhere. Oh, interesting. I should read the news more often. This looks like a really credible source to me. Granted, it's still the media, like I was saying about the other one, media is hard to I still feel good about this, though. And what makes this more reliable, um, like I was saying What was the word I used? Diplomatic. Right. This article, in comparison to the last, is just more diplomatic. It's clear to me that someone with a much more formal writing style was the author than the last. The sight was full of much more important topics. More of a nationally known source compared to the last radio source. When you can't spell. corrects spelling of diplomatic before moving on to the second sentence in the more reliable answer box. There's still that media factor. The sight was pretty political. I didn't spend enough time on it to decipher if it leaned more to the liberal or conservative side, but most often sources like that do so that's something you've got to watch out for. global warming fail. What? This is interesting. This is a stance on this issue that I have never heard before. And for that, for that reason, because it just seems so uncommon, so uniqueI don't know how well I trust it. And what's all this on the side? Okay, this is something that makes me weary, too. All this junk on the right hand side. Bad news about what's this, met form in? Yeah, all these weird health things, I mean it's not Dr. Oz, but it's like that thing, it's sponsored by these extra sites or whatever. I don't know. It just doesn't seem very credible to me. The blaze. Also something I've never heard of. Digital network that provides a platform for a new generation of authentic and unfiltered voices. Hmm. I don't know about this. TV channel, radio, voice. Okay, so another radio thing. No. Mmm-mmm. See, this little first thing to me. How to get rid of deep belly fat? Scams like that, that are like, one of the first things I see. Yeah, I don't I don't know about that. And you see, this has articles that are, that are interesting to read, I'm not going to put a damper on that, but see like This barber for the homeless offers more than just a haircut¬ù like that's wonderful and uplifting, but not something I necessarily want to cite in a research paper, I mean, I like to think that my research Deserves a little more dignity than that, I guess. What makes this more reliable to me? I mean honestly, obviously, if it quotes things. Who are they even quoting? Some professor. Okay. Like, that's cool he has this opinion, but and then they try to pull in this NASA thing, just to show that it is melting, but I don't see the correlation here, like it specifies that the ice is melting, but this graph and this information don't show anything about the welfare of the animals, so they're kind of twisting that information. More reliable: Obviously someone was quoted in saying all this; a professor. The information that they use from really credible sources, like NASA, don't have anything to do with the welfare of the animals, they just prove the fact that the ice is melting. I think maybe I should double-check that graph and make sureYeah. It's just about ice levels. That's interesting, though. Because if I were an animal, I wouldn't really want to live in the Arctic. That sounds awful. Hmm, okay. The Washington Post, see this is something, I've read. This newspaper. A fairly good amount. It's something, it's a site, that I've honestly learned about. And see, comparing it to that last one, that had all the stuff on the right hand side, this one, I mean, this just has blips from the own site, its own site, instead of just ads, this already makes me trust it more. I mean there's a math equation at the top, so obviously they're smart about, I don't know what that means, I'm bad at math, okay all said in jest, I think Okay I like this article. I would say it's very credible Just from looking at it. And because I'm familiar with the Washington Post. I should look it up. I should look something else up about this Elon Musk's Space X. Okay, so here's some article about it, proving that, test-fire. I'm familiar with the Washington Post. I feel like the things I've read from it have been very informative in the past. What I like about this particular article, though, is that it's not someone's opinion. It's just some random new story, but about an actual event, and an actual piece of technological advancement. I don't feel like there's a reason not to trust it. I like that it says that it's not as clean and shiny as they usually are. I like this article. I don't really have a reason not to trust it. And I guess if I'm saying that, I better give it a 10, right? Okay, cool. Okay, this one has hashtags on the top. Interesting. Oh, I have candy in my backpack! Okay. Wow, that's sad. Eeh. Mm. Okay, so this Daily Kos isn't something I've ever heard of, but I like the style of its article.Okay, so right here. This screen that I'm on. No one should ever lose their voting rights, not even temporarily, sign if you agree. Kinda makes me trust it less, obviously just because it's very one-sided. Very liberal, here. Uses twitter feed. I don't know. I kind of like that. Makes it real, makes it more raw. Um, I mean, I'd say that it's a credible source. I just like The Washington Post, it's just more on that liberal side of things. And I think this sounds like a really interesting article, it obviously uses a lot of information from surveys and um, I mean, these are real numbers that it uses. I'd give it a nine. Uses real survey numbers and I like that it's about something that really makes a difference-something relatable. We all know people who have jobs, and we all know people who need jobs, and we all know old people. It's clearly a very liberal sight, not that liberal people aren't credible, but we have to be careful using sources that are so one-sided.
