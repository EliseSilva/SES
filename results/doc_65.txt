Okay, um, so as far as reliable hold on let me read it. Um, so I guess the reliability of this article would be  probably around a 9. An 8 or a 9. The only reason I don't give it a 10, maybe, is because there were some things that just sounded kind of weird. We wrote about it and everything. It's not very flow. It doesn't have a lot of flow. The ideas that it's trying to express, and honestly it's not really necessary, really, and there are just a couple of other things. I guess other than that I would consider it reliable, just from what I can read. Um, as far as the second tab, let's see, where is the second tab? So what I'm doing is going to the NPR website, which is the website that supposedly published this article, and I'm going to go to over the counter birth control and see if I can find that. Yep, here's the article. So this, so I'm kind of going through the article a little bit, but um, I'm not going to read it all, but the way I'm going to check its credibility. Well, I could listen to it being said. Okay, so as far as the reliability of this, as far as the credibility of it, I guess I would say you know, as far as I can tell, that it is credible. Um, just because there is audio evidence and like, conversation, I mean, you can kind of hear it. The only thing I'm not sure of, maybe, is the credibility of this website, or how reliable it is, and honestly, I don't think I know how to, how I would go about that, checking the reliability of the website. But as far as the article goes, to me it sounds reliable, so I'm going to give it about a 9. I believe the reliability comes from audio evidence. Although I guess it comes from a prominent website, which is what I'm going to put, I actually have never heard of this website. National Public  I don't know what the R says. National Public something. Anyway, I'm not entirely familiar with it, so that's one thing that is kind of a con to this. As far as the lack of reliability, it would just be probably being unfamiliar with the website, and I don't know like, what, the credibility of those who carry it out. Who carried this study out, or this article out, I guess. The reliability comes from audio evidence from the website of the doctors and experts cited in the article. It also comes from a prominent news website. I am unsure with this website, and I do not know the credibility of the authors of the articles. Okay, so I guess I'm gonna check the reliability of this website. So I guess from what I'm understanding is that this person, okay, so this person is the president and founder of some sort of university, although it does say college, so that is a little bit sketchy. She says I am privileged to serve with president of this university, when a university definitely is not a college. A college could be any university, but, so that's a little strange. So I'm reading the article to see exactly what it is that it's talking about. So now I'm going to um, this website Huff Post, to I guess, find this article again. Okay, so I found the article. And I guess from what it seems like, it's definitely a legit article from this website, but this website I'm not sure, like, then again, I really can't say if I know that this really is reliable, just because I read it on a website. Um, I don't know. It's kind of this person's opinion, and she is trying to be persuasive about it, so I guess that is the purpose of it, but . . . but as far as the reliability of itI'm just really, really not sure, how I'd go about finding the reliability of this article at all. Um. Yeah, it's pretty much expressing this person's opinion, a strong opinion about the way that education should be in universities. And I guess her credibility goes to the fact that she's a president of a college. ButI would not know how to go about. I mean, I may use this for some sort of English assignment or something, but I don't know if I would consider this, or how reliable I would consider this, give it like a 6. Um, cause it does, it looks okay. And it's coming from a, actually I'm going to give it a 5. I don't know. It's just, it feels, what qualities make this source more reliable for me? I guess, her credibility, or the credibility of the author, because she is a president, so, I guess that's what makes it less reliable is there's nothing else that tells me that it's not from some random person. Like, it's just, this person wrote her opinion, and that's fine, but I guess, there's no audio evidence, there's no video, I feel like I would need something else, to like use as, to see it's reliable.More reliable: The credibility of the author.Less reliable: There is nothing else that tells me it's not from some random person. Now I'm testing the reliability of this website, I guess. Um, soI guess from what I can see in this website, is that it's somewhat reliable, I'll give it an 8.Because it gives links to its sources, like in a news studies by researchers and it gives you a link to click on it and see if it's true, now as to the credibility of that one, I don't know, but it's citing different sources, it's citing people involved in it. There's this professor Ronnie. So I mean, so I guess that does help me a little bit in the credibility, or in believing the credibility, but that's just it, that's just believing, that somehow these links are other testimonies or evidences that somehow this is a credible source. So. It's really just a matter of like, me going about it this way, I guess. Or believing that it's that way. I do like the chart, though, that it gives. I'm not sure if that helps with its credibility, but for me, I don't know, so that's a little more convincing I guess. So. So, found the website, the article, so let's see if it sends me to any of these sources.Here it is, based on the study that was linked to it. Let's see if um, these other ones will take me to some other ones. Okay, that's so, so um, I'm clicking these links and going to these websites to double-check.That this is a reliable, so two of the links are actually the same source, which is, I guess that's okay. But they do show more links after the chart, so I mean I guess, I'd probably consider this one more reliable than the last one, just because it has a little bit more, like, the links, the links that show more a little more evidence, there are quotes from press releases, I mean this it's not somebody's opinion. I don't know. So. Yeah. I'd probably consider this fairly reliable. Maybe the source, maybe what qualities and attributes that make it less reliableI honestly don't know. I'll look at this website again.Cause it does have some sort of visual evidence here, it has this chart. I honestly don't know what I would put as far as less reliable.Um, as far as reliable, I'm probably just going to go with about a nine. Almost a ten. Nine and a half. So. Um.  I guess maybe, one quality makes it less reliable, maybe just because it is. Cause, let's be honest, there are websites that are conservative, and there are websites that are liberal, and I actually do know this website, and I do know it to be more on the conservative side of things, so I don't know how biased it is as well, so, but as far as what they say, it's backed up with some evidence, and with links, so I mean, maybe just a little bit of bias. I'm not sure if that would make it less reliable for me, honestly I'd consider it reliable. But maybe just for the sake of this, it's just less reliable. More Reliable: The links help to support the claimed information in the article. Maybe the bias of a partisan-leaning website. Okay.Okay, so with this next article, I mean it does come from the Washington Post, which, so I do know that to be an actual website. That's just a matter of looking at its article and seeing how credible it might be. Oh, um. My computer shut off on me. Or at least the monitor, I don't know what's going on. Um, I'm gonna have to go get the lady. Okay, um, so as far as the credibility, this, so as far as I can see Let's see, Hunnington sic postI wonder if this is Nope, this is definitely not the same one, hang on.So I'm just looking up the article again, there it is.So it does have video, gonna look at the video. Okay, so. I guess with the video it kind of, I guess it could support a little bit of what the claims, yeah, I mean I guess as far as what it's claiming, it's just claiming that this thing launched. And they did quote some of the people in it, so as far as reliability, I would put it right around an 8. And evidence probably aroundwell, let's see. Video evidence and direct quotes. Partisan leaningMaybe also partisan bias, just because I know that it's, I think I know that the site is party-based, not party-based, but it's notorious sometimes for leaning to one side. So I'll put Partisan leaning against. The Daily Kos. So first of all, I don't know this website. But it is So let's see, it does have links, like the Blaze had. That website. Um. To go to other sources. Okay, so, I'm on the website. Okay, so, this is heavily partisan-based.  Definitely. Because it says here at the very end, But to Republicans, making American Great Again does not involve protecting Vedderr's health or making sure that people who provide health care make a living wage. So definitely partisan-based, which makes it for me unreliable. Um, I guess, to a certain extent, I guess it makes it unreliable because I always know that there's going to be a bias. And I guess I don't know to what extent they may be just, trying to prove their point, or do they actually have evidence, and from what I can see here, they do have evidence, but they only have quotes from um, people, and this, I don't know how generalized this study can be because it's mainly focused on only a couple of people. Um. I don't know, okay, so, here are links to this survey. So yeah, it makes some pretty generalized claims that are not necessary true, like, At the federal level and in altogether too many states, Republicans are standing in the way of adequate funding. That's making claims like that, that I guess don't have any, any straight credibility to them. Um, yeah. I'm honestly, as far as credibility, with just the screenshot, I probably would have given it like a six. And now, having read the article, I'd probably have to give it a four.  And what makes it more reliable are probably the links to what they're, cited sources. But what makes it less reliable is it's heavily partisan-based. And for me, basically, anything that's obviously partisan-based in any direction, it's not, it's just not very reliable. Cause I don't know exactly how I can measure credibility of just someone who's trying to prove their point to me in some way.
