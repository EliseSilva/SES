Shots, from KUER 90.1, that sounds like a radio station, sounds like it could be biased. Honestly, right off the bat that is what I hear.  A review of oral contraceptive research? That sounds very vague.  Okay, that sounds a lot more credible. I'd rate this somewhere between 4 and 6. I'll put in my personal bias and rate it 4. I'm really curious as to where they got this first statement. Why are you bringing up teens in this?  Okay, I was a little lost Pretty sure hormonal birth control is slightly different than birth control. Sorry, I'm just reading all these things in my head, I'll read aloud. I don't see much evidence; they just make a claim right here. I don't see or feel like anything is backing that up. I mean that almost sounds like a snippet, I don't know, like they grabbed a little snippet of something you want to hear. I could grab something from President Obama's speech and put it in my math homework, it just sounds kind of ridiculous. Likes authenticity in writing. Preferably with sources that sound credible and aren't misused to sound deceiving. There were many little things that bothered him; article was vague, not concrete, felt like it was all over the place. A third way for universities, what does that mean? That's more or less. 6.5 First rating at 6.5.  Just skimming through this, sorry. OK, yeah, I can't really say much else about that, so I will give it the same score, because it is kind of vague online. Seems very authentic; there aren't many sources attributed to this claim, so he is all for learning more about the idea of starting or improving universities. Not many outside sources.There weren't any outside sources, or other sources I could find, so I don't know. But seeing. I felt like it could go both ways because there aren't many outside sources, you could argue that, it's more something, it's something that I've been researching, this is my own research, this has been my experience with my own college. There aren't many stories out there of how other universities like John Hopkins or Yale got their start, it's so far back. I wouldn't even know how to start looking for that kind of stuff. Same kind of logic without outside sources. Not having many outside sources. Global warming, cool! The Blaze news, okay. I am kind of biased towards global warming, I'm actually not sure if I should believe it or not. My question is, what is global warming.  Part of my bias is, we used to have ice ages, ages of pure tundras of ice. Continents were covered in solid ice. So I mean, earth changes. Pretty sure mankind wasn't the reason these ice ages stopped. I am also a bio major, that might make me more biased. I mean before earth was Pangea, when it was first created, it was just a giant ball of hot gas. I mean, sure, they are really low  My dad is a plumber, so I know some things about water heaters. Typical water heaters are about 50 gallons, so this is talking about 5 water heaters per metric ton This is 5 billion water heaters that's actually kind of a lot Sounds really credible to me, honestly.  Keeps skimming through article, then moves on to qualities/attributes. Well because I am biased I find this article very reliable and I give myself an estimate of how much is truly being melted. And my background in biology helps a ton as well. Well there really isn't much to argue, sounds like they have a credible source, NASA. I can't really make it seem less reliable, I mean, they have sources from NASA, who I think of as very credible. How many of these are there?! It's 9:48, I've got to be quick Looks very credible, just by the title, it just sounds scientific. Yeah, that is very true. Okay, I'm all for this. And, because I am short on time. First source I found was space debris. This has to be recycled, I'm sure scientists can find a way. Well maybe it's from the Washington post it makes it a little biased. Oh okay, I know all about this, because I was a CNA.  You make this sound more tedious than it actually is. This kind of annoys me. $10/hour to lift an adult into and out of bed or the shower, that's $10, the minimum wage in Utah is $7! Okay, I feel like you are creating a sob story, but I mean, it is very biased.  Sorry, but I was a CNA, I know all this stuff.  A 6, because I don't like you. 42:20Yeah, I don't really have to search anything I know already. They hate their lives. If you really want to, be an EMT. They get paid pretty good. It's like only one semester for an EMT. Seriously. More reliable: Well a lot of what was stated is very true.Less reliable: Many things are left out, making this sound more sob-like. Also I have experience as a CNA.I mean, the reason this sounds sob-like, or like this job is terrible, is you are lifting an adult into or out of bed or the shower, I mean, they give you the lift, you don't actually carry the person. You do assist the person if they can walk, but if you can't, you have the lift  It's called ambulating the patient, but if you can't, then you have the lift. Other people have wheelchairs. There's a whole procedure for how to do it. There's a mat, you pick them up, I mean, yeah.
