So I don't really know who the article is from. So I'm gonna look what NPR is. The layout of the website makes it more reliable to me. They talk about their business being in story-telling. I just want the facts. So I'm just gonna go to the website and see if it's reliable. Like what kind of stories and headlines they have.  So like, top videos, if there's stuff that, like this Mike Pence thing doesn't really matter, with the adorable kid. Or like Parks and Recs tweets. But it is Huffington Post, which is well-known. The title of the website is well known so it makes me think it is reliable. The headlines on the website were things that were not very important, so that made it less reliable to me. Then proceeds to the next survey question. So again I'm just going to the website to check it out. Cause I've never heard of the Blaze. But the internet says it's an American conservative and news platform, and it's founded by Glenn Beck, and so there's kind of some bias there with his outlook on things, so it's probably a little biased, so that makes it a little less reliable to me. I liked the use of graphs to prove the articles points. The website/company was started by Glenn Beck so I feel that there is some bias to is. I have also never heard of it. So I'm just looking up the Washington post. I like that it says analysis. So it's not just giving facts but it's giving what they're thinking. They have things that are going on live. And their headline Democracy dies in darkness just showing what's important to them. So, go Washington post. Their mantra of 'Democracy dies in darkness' and live feeds show the viewer they value their role in society to provide news and analysis of it. Nothing really. Then she proceeds to the next question. So I've never heard of Daily Kos again. It says it has political analysis from a liberal perspective. And I don't really wanna read something with a specific perspective. I'd rather be able to make an assumption for myself. And I don't like this petition ad thing that pulls up.So I'm not super impressed with it. Therefore, I don't really think it's super reliable. Nothing really. It has a liberal view and the ad that popped up about signing a petition when I first came to the page.¬ù
