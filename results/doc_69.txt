I would probably rate this a 7 on reliability just by looking at the screen shot and without looking at anything else, just because it is by NPR news and it did come out this year so it looks like it's recent. It looks like they have a lot of links that you can go and read more about it. They have their credentials that look pretty good. Because they're talking about a professor from the pediatrics of the John Hopkins school of medicine and John Hopkins is obviously a really good school for medicine. I'm going to use a new browser so I can open some of the links. First, I want to find out who Rebecca Hersher is to see if she has any credentials that would make me want to believe her in the first place. It doesn't really tell a lot about her so that's not really helpful. So I clicked on a link that says Wrote about it in everything where it says Why?So they have the pills to prevent pregnancy, so that's why they shouldn't have prescriptions so that they can..so that pregnancy rates go lower is what I think they're trying to say?I'm kind of just skimming over this. They come down here and talk about acetaminophen and overdoses of Aspirin, Tylenol have an effect on people. So they have done their research, they have gone over the negatives and the positives for it. I'd say it's a pretty reliable I mean it has stuff from Doctors and Researchers. I would never give anything a perfect 10  for reliability, cause everybody has flaws in their writings. I couldn't find that much information about the author of the article. The author cites her sources and her sources are credible. What?Ah these words are so little. I can't see that. Just by looking at this I'd say the reliability would be pretty low just because I can barely read what it's saying. And when I don't like what a website looks likes I'm like whatever I'll find a new one. So I wouldn't even read over this that much.  But I guess since I have to read over itIt doesn't have a really A third way for universities That's not a title that makes sense to me, like I don't know what it is talking about.  9:33I definitely agree with that end part. Um, yeah general education sucks and you don't want to take your GEs but it helps you to be a well-rounded student so that you're not just career specific. Because there are people who are career specific, so say you have a student who has a 4.0 super high on the ACT whatever they're super smart. But that's all they're smart on is book smart. And I think that's the problem that we're running into when people want to take GEs that are in different subject so they're only smart in one subject. Then they don't have common sense in other things that are just as important and so like GEs are still important for that reason even though some of them are not fun to take. They have a lot of information and they have quotes from resourceful people. The ads on the side. What?? That doesn't seem?...The Blaze? K first off it's called the blaze That doesn't seem like a reliable website. They have ads everywhere and usually websites that are just made by normal people who don't have a lot of educational experience have lots of ads I feel like. Maybe that's not real but Okay, so It does quote credible sources about NASA, about them quoting NASA they're not quoting them on that the global warming is actually good, they're quoting them on their data for the lowest recordedumLand Ice Loss. So you'd think it's credible because they're talking about NASA, and the National Snow and Ice Data Center. So you'd think it's gotta be credible cause it's quoting that, but they're not quoting them on that global warming is a good thing, just on the land ice loss. I don't know I wouldn't think this is a credible source right off the top of my head because everything I've ever heard of global warming is totally the opposite of what this says. Graph and charts. Not really any credible sources. Also I don't know who the author is. Christian Davenport. I always like to see who the author is just to see what theyHe's a reporter for the Washington Post. Ok, I know the Washington Post is a good website because all of my teachesr make us go on that one. So immediately I'm thinking eh that's pretty credible because it's from the Washington Post and my teachers always tell me to look there for stuff so. Ooh Rolex Watches, Rolex Watches are so expensive, what the heck? Continues reading. Okay. So I'm like thinking it's a credible source because it's from The Washington Post I'm like hey seems like a credible source. no external links for me to click on for more information. Also, I don't know where he's getting his information. I feel like I'm going to fast on this, I don't know!What? PFT! Okay so I totally agree with this post! Holy crap. I'm a CNA and I've worked a nursing home and $10.00 an hour is not enough for what I do. But I love taking care of people so that's why I do it. But yeah that's true they should definitely raise the wage for that, but in most places it is honestly. This article is from 2017, what? Laughs, I want to show this article to my boss and say like Yo! You're not paying us enough. What? Making America great Again. What the heck Trump? Old people are awesome, they need help.  Okay I think this is really reliable, mostly just because I really like what they are saying. I agree with what is being said. There are external links you can click on as well for more information.But again they Well I guess they have some external links you can click on. I don't feel like there is a lot of science I mean I like the science and data that comes with this type of post. I mean I have taken care of people who say they don't have that much of a disability so it was definitely a lot easier. So times like that it'd be like okay $10.00 an hour I can work with this, I'm not running around like a chicken with my head cut off, blah blah blah. But other people depending on their disability it's quite more difficult and it takes more time and more effort and I think it those circumstances I think the wage should be riserose? Made higher? Publishing date for sure, if it's super out dated I don't think it will be a reliable source. Hyperlinks to outside sources definitely. Design of a website?...eh? it's not like super good. Advertising yeahdomain type? Oh, I didn't even look at that but like yeah? But yeah for sure at school I'll look at that. But at the same time if they have really good hyperlinks to other sources I won't really care if it's a .com. Your emotional response, haha yeah we figured that one out. With most sources, I'm kind of lazy so not every single one honestly.
