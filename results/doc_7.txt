Okay, so the first one, NPR. Awesome. Open the article. Okay, reliability, NPR. Shots. Where is the link? This is a strange line right here. It sounds really weird to say and everything right afterwards. I like the use of the multiple quotes from people, obviously. That doesn't seem quite. In fact, she says So I'm guessing that I don't have to talk about anything that the article is talking about specifically; however, I'm supposed to talk the quality of the article. Okay, there are lots of quotes, lot of opinions on her. Direct quotes, especially. I would say it's fairly reliable, it's NPR, it's the article before they are published are widely read by a lot of editors, before they're published, and lots of quotes directly from the sources. Any negatives about this, I would say, like I said before, the tone seems fairly conversational. This sentence here just kind of bugs me. But that's just a preference, I don't think it says anything about the article itself. Both sides of the issue are stressed, with obstetricians and gynecologists speaking about how it's not a good substitute. But lots of other people such as the creators of the pill itself and the school of medicine. Krishna, I don't know how to say that name, but she's talks about this a lot. Gives some statistics that are easily read and easily understood. So yeah, for that reason, I would give it a 9 in credibility, I'll just move it to 10. Seems like a very reliable article, although. Let me see something. Okay, 10, because it also gives a direct link to the articles that they speak about. Just in case you want to double check, fact check them.I would say I would give it a 10  And then I can guess I can move this to a 9, because once I went to the article, I was able to click on these links. Overall, what qualities or attributes made the source more reliable to you. Direct quotations from sources; links to sources provided; statistics given that were easily understood. Yeah, I think that's all I spoke about. For the less reliable it would be. Conversational tone.I don't even know if that's a good idea to say, that it's conversational, that it's a bad thing, because this is all things considered, they usually have an audio recording, right there, so they're actually speaking over the radio to people, so it has to be conversational so then they'll listen. I don't think that's a very bad attribute, it's just not to my liking. Direct quotations from sources; links to sources provided; statistics given that were easily understood. Conversational tone.Next article. Okay, so just with the screen shots, I'm supposed to evaluate it. This is the Huffington Post. I'm not very familiar with the Huffington Post, so I don't know very much about their logo. Or about, I'm fairly familiar with them, I know what they talk about usually. So it's usually more opinionated than NPR. Okay, it's not capitalized here, I don't know if this is. oh I see, never mind, it's a different page, my bad. This seems more editorial, more journalistic than the other article, which seemed more fact-based, well, not fact-based, but they didn't speak their opinion as much. This seems to be a little more opinionated. It's by one person. I don't know, never mind. Yeah, more opinionated. Career-specific education  Classical liberal learning. So this one is looking for to teach, I guess it's not really that important for what I'm doing right now. It's talking about how teachers need to be directly involved, or choose a path, and students need to choose a path as well, and everything that they learn about should be about what they plan on doing for their career.And the other one is more focused on the arts as well as what they want to do for their career. So it's not too difficult to understand, it's conversational, but I don't feel like they lose anything from being conversational.So in our colleges  source. They don't provide the links to the sources. I don't know. I'll go to the website afterwards, but it doesn't seem like they do here. They also don't seem to have nearly as many quotes, direct quotes at least. Right here it says, the Harvard Business Review, Michael D. King suggested. And it doesn't give quotations, it doesn't say his quote, it's merely paraphrasing what he said. Which I like the direct quotes better, it makes it seem more reliable. So I'll give it an 8.5, you can scale it From just the picture alone, so.What are these?  Okay, so they do give the direct, they give statistics, but they kind of paraphrase it here, whereas they give you the link to look at it, if you want to look at the direct statistics. If I were them, I would have put the statistics directly on the page, made them easier to understand, just like NPR did, I thought they did a great job at that.They have clickbait-y ads, I don't like that. I don't think NPR had those. And it gives another one. So they gives lots of indirect quotes. Let's see if it's a direct quote. Doesn't seem like a direct quote to me. And of course it gives their opinion at the end. Clickbait articles at the bottom. So yeah, not too bad, but I don't think it was quite as NPR's was. So I'll give it a 9, because I saw the direct links to the articles. Indirect quotations instead of direct.There's no real data on this, was that the wrong one. There's no real data on the screen. Let's see. Yeah, right here, Nearly 40 years and tens of thousands of gainfully employed alumni later, I'm happy to say that we've been a success. It doesn't really say how many alumni agreed, or how many career services that our school has provided. What made it good.Less reliable:Indirect quotations instead of direct; no direct statistics (given in links outside of article); opinionated; click-bait ads. Links to further pages of information; quotes; Because this article was a little more opinionated, the conversational tone, they give their opinion at the end, I feel like it was more opinionated, because of that, it was a little less reliable, because it could have some inherent bias in it.More reliable: Links to further pages of information; quotes (indirect); Indirect quotations instead of direct; no direct statistics (given in links outside of article); opinionated; click-bait ads.All right. The Blaze. I've never heard of this. Oh, I, all right. So it looks like these have very click-bait-y articles, they don't seem to be very, good. They have a sports article here. These don't seem very, I don't know what the word is, reliable, I suppose. They have the Christian discipline ad at the top. I'm guessing this is going to be more conservative, obviously by the title, you can tell, that's very conservative. Proponents of the theory humans are primarily responsible. What? I don't understand why it says proponents of the theory. It should say, proponents of the theory say humans are responsible. Obviously I'm not, am I reading it wrong? Is this because of the way I'm reading it, or the screenshot, or maybe it's on this page, I don't know. But there should definitely be a say here, it doesn't make sense otherwise, so obviously if there's going to be grammatical errors, it's not going to be that edited of a page, and if there's not much edittation, if that's a word, you should edit me, if they didn't edit it very much, then perhaps you could realize that Justin Haskins, whoever wrote it, obviously it's his opinion, and it's a pretty biased opinion, I suppose. The University of Southern Denmark. So there's a new study reading from screen shots.Well, yeah, obviously I don't agree with this whatsoever. Obviously, the animals, just because they're thriving doesn't mean that they're going to do better in the future. Sure it may be warmer for them now, and they usually thrive in the spring and the summer when it's warmer, and that's when they mate and eat a lot, and if it's like that more and more, they're going to be better, but when it gets hotter in the long run, it's going to be hard for them to survive. A lot of food to adapt to that, if it's even around by then. It's the artic, so the ice won't last forever. Anyway, I digress.So they have quotes here. Stated the press release. So it says a press release, not any press release specifically, so obviously that's a problem. I mean, is the press release from the University of Southern Denmark? According to a press release touting the study's new findings. So the press released the study's new findings. I haven't heard anything about it. So fairly recently. It's the University of Southern Denmark. Not anything wrong with Southern Denmark, but it's pretty far away, and it doesn't seem too, that large of a college, university. I mean, if a larger college stated that or multiple colleges agreed with that.So, mats of algae and bacteria can evolve in the melt ponds. I keep hating to digress, but once too much algae appears in the melt ponds, it's going to suffocate all the animals in the water, and once it does that, there's just going to be no food for the marine creatures. Well, I guess there will be food but no oxygen for them to breathe.So that's a fun fact.So they do have statistics here. Let's see. NASA and the national snow and ice data center. Okay. So the ice is going down by a lot. Definitely true.I do not like this article.I mean, it does give some statistics that seem to go against what they're saying, but I don't know. So their whole argument is that climate change is good because the animals are happy in the warm weather. And that they're saying, what scientists are saying is true. The title is obviously is very biased, and the article seems very biased, which is probably why I'm rating it as low as I did. I'll open a browser in a second, but I'm going to jot down my thoughts because I'm fairly scatterbrained. What makes this source more reliable to you? Provides links to what the article is saying; direct quotes Does not give specifics when it comes to press release; obvious bias, especially in title and conclusion; not a well known or touted source, which is not backed up especially well with other sources; sparse statistics; click-bait articles and advertisements; grammatical errors i.e. Proponents of the theory say humans are; sources have obvious bias as well.Even though they did have statistics, they were fairly sparse.Let me just look at the blaze real quick.Yeah, it wasn't filtered, I forgot that. Yeah, I don't like the look of this website.What? I shouldn't digress, but I definitely know that's a Christain post.com This brings up a completely different article. So, I feel like I'm digressing here, but this says, no Thomas Jefferson did not, but it says he might know. Oh boy. Let's see. That just makes me. Oh boy. The world's most viewed site on global warming. I've never heard this thing. Top 100  and they said they're the most. Obvious bias from them. The sources have obvious bias as well. So I clicked on a new study, thinking it would take me to the study, but instead it brings me to this. Which doesn't bring me to the study at all. I'm going to rate it lower, just because the sources are obviously not good at all. Might even give it a 4.5. The sources are just as terrible as the website itself. It's just as the biased as the other. Provides links to what the article is saying; direct quotes. Does not give specifics when it comes to press release; obvious bias, especially in title and conclusion; not a well known or touted source, which is not backed up especially well with other sources; sparse statistics; click-bait articles and advertisements; grammatical errors i.e. Proponents of the theory say humans are; sources have obvious bias as well. Washington Post. I feel like they're a little more credible than the Blaze because they're more well known and for fact checking. Let's go ahead and look at this. Flight proven rocket. So again, more conversational than statistical. Although they do give specific times and direct quotations. Click-bait-y articles. You know those articles are usually for revenue, obviously ad revenue. I'm just saying that a more credible source, like a, primary source wouldn't have these, because it'd probably be published as a published thing on the internet without any ads. I don't know what I'm saying. That's what I've seen before.I'm getting distracted here. I would say it's an 8 maybe.I don't see any of the links included, but let's look at that website.So it does come with a video. I like that.No links in the article. Maybe they'll be in inaudibleOkay, so right here, it says that, it talks about Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post.Yeah, isn't he the person before Amazon.So because there's a possibility of conflict of interest, they make sure to mention that he owns the Washington Post, which is a very good thing to do. I've heard NPR do that a lot when they talk about McDonalds they saying, the owner of McDonalds was a huge contributor to NPR back in the day, he donated millions of dollars. When they were talking about the movie for McDonalds, I never saw it, but I heard about it on NPR.Let me just look real quick to make sure that it doesn't. Okay, so it has more click-bait articles at the end. I don't see any in-article links. More reliable:Video to back up claims; direct quotations; gives full disclosure when talking about Jeff Bezos's contributions, as he is the owner of the Washington Post; not very opinionated.Less reliable: click-bait articles; no in article links to statistics.I would say it's an 8.5/9ish.It does have some cons that the NPR article didn't have in it. But overall, it wasn't a super controversial thing. It's kind of a puff piece I suppose. I mean it's important, but it's not, like something that's going to cause controversy and argument. Everyone knows that rocket went off into space. Just reporting on the fact. Just not super opinionated. Daily Kos.Okay, so same click-bait articles. Very opinionated. Very conversational dialogue. Looks like they have faces. Melania Trump thinks we're stupid Okay, obvious bias here as well, probably for the other side. Okay, so they don't give direct statistics, I mean they do here, but become harder to fill jobs Okay here, I do like how they give direct statistics. And I think these are links, we'll have to click on them later. So far, not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Direct quotations.So here, it already starts to blame people. And blame is never good in an article because it usually means bias. You should let your readers decide who to blame, not decide for them. Okay, it gives an emotional thing right here, which is a good thing for an article, but it can also influence people's decisions. Yeah, here it goes on, and says something blatantly.  I don't think that's true. I'm not a Republican, I'm not even a conservative, but I don't think they'd want to make sure that he doesn't have good health. It's very opinionated, very, I don't think he/she/whoever wrote this. They're obviously speaking to an audience that wants to hear that. And, they don't provide really any other explanation other than just they're blaming someone. They don't say why they're doing something wrong, I guess it just speaks to how they're decreasing Medicaid, maybe if they give statistics or a quote on how they want to make sure veteran's health is not protected because they really really care about that. I don't like this article at all. It was growing on me for a second with all of their statistics but they lost me when they became too biased. So let's go take a look at it for a second. Focused on liberal American politics. Yeah, Daily Kos. Oh boy, if you get enough people to sign the petition, Trump's not going to be president any more. Heck. It shouldn't be asking me for tips. Anyway, let's click on the links. And of course, instead of giving a primary source, they give a secondary source  that don't really. 5 minutes left. I'd better finish then. Direct statistics; direct quotes; links to statistics. extremely biased; links to only secondary sources; conclusion w/o evidence on other's thinking/blames othersWhereas the NPR and Huffington Post gave primary sources. Thought it was a little higher. Direct statistics; direct quotes; links to statistics. extremely biased; links to only secondary sources; conclusion w/o evidence on other's thinking/blames others
