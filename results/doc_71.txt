Starts reading instruction page. It has an author, the date, the hour it was published. I'm going to give it an 8 out of 10, because the webpage design looks cool, I think. Okay, so I am going to search this researcher that is cited here, Krishna Upadhya. Okay, so I googled her, and I will search the research cited in the article, and I am going to compare the information given in the article with what it actually says in the Johns Hopkins Medicine webpage. She is an assistant professor of Pediatrics, has an M.D & M.P.H And this seems right, because the information given about this researcher is alright. Then I'm going to search the. So here in the abstract of the publication in the journal, it's talking about the topic of the article, so I think that I am going to put , because I don't really know the webpage of the article presented here (NPR). They cited a qualified researcher, and the information given at least in the researcher part can be found online. The webpage has not too many ads, so it's a sign of reliability. The fact that I don't recognize the webpage can be a factor to not trust it.It seems like it is the webpage of the Huffington Post, but in the banner of the website it says 'Huffpost'. It also has lots of ads, so it seems like this webpage is more kind of lucrative. Many of the lucrative webpages focus on having clicks. So . I give it a 6 at the first view. It also has the author, so you can google the author, it also has the date and time of publication, so that is kind of reliable. But the fact that it has lots of ads is kind of alarming. So I can prove that this article is from the Huffington Post, and at least the article was written by a professor of a university, or an important person. The author appears to be an important person, she has lots of publications, and the website is of a famous newspaper. The website has lots of ads. The ads are a sign that this website is commercial, I think.  I referred to the other source they cited, just in USA Today, and the USA Today article said that it is NOT actually helping animals. In the actual USA Today article is says that 'this melting affects wildlife such as polar bears, seals, and walruses.' So, it's not reliable, I think. Also I have noticed that most of the reliable websites, the beginning of their URL or link starts with https, not http, Because https is a security protocol  so, the reliable websites have this https protocol because they want their information secure, they are less prone to hackers. The information is well organized. The other articles cited say opposite information than the actual article provides. The site has lots of ads and the URL of the actual article publication starts with the http:// protocol (more secure websites have https:// protocol). Okay, this is the Washington Post, so it makes sense that this information is reliable, because the Washington Post is a very recognized, very famous newspaper. It also seems to have a video related with the article. People always want evidence, and a video can be evidence of the information given below.  So yeah, the information seems to be alright. So as you see, this webpage is of the Washington post, that is a very recognized newspaper, very famous. The protocol of the URL is https, so it is secure, it is private. Even though you don't have to sign in or anything, the programmers of the webpage have the resources to make this website secure. So it has to have a lot of financial power, they have the money to promote their investigation, to have really good sources of information.  You can also see the biography of the author, you can see that he is always writing about space rockets and science and technology. He is always writing this kind of publication, so he has been doing this job for a while. SO you can say he is a very reliable source, you cannot get away with writing about these things for a long time if your information is incorrect. So I give this The author has other publications about similar topic, the video can be used as evidence to support the article info, the website protocol is secure. I think they have ads, but not too much. It has no external links. So if I see this (pop-up ad) I am going to give it a. Looks through the Daily KOS website, looking at the frequency of different hashtags/topics. I think this is kind of a more popular website. I think that it is not serious. The author doesn't seem very recognized, she is just a person. But it seems like Time magazine has rated it the second-best blog, but even though everything is basically opinion, a blog is written by external people. The website name is recognized by other reliable sources (other magazines), cites other publications and has a But the fact that this is classified as a blog bugs me. The other websites were newspapers, but they call themselves a blog. I like the website a lot. If you do a good website, it is because you have the people to do it, and if you have the people to do it, you have the financial support to do it. If you have that financial support.
