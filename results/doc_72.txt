How effective are the birth control pills?  I still don't think it is a good idea for the kids under 18 years old to receive the birth control pills without prescription from the doctor, because when we are young, we don't think all the way through it, and we don't have the experience to make decisions that we are not capable of, especially to the unknown field. It's still better for the kids to have some limits. Not to get the birth control pill.  Someone who know what he/she is talking about. Provided a name to prove its credibility. The title just seems irresponsible. There is always a reason society sets up rules and laws to protect the teens, especially their judgement is not fully developed. I feel like many people they might think what they learn in school, for example like math and sciences, they won't be able to apply it later in life or for their work, but those classes are not only for their future career, but also to develop the way that we think. So it is kind of like a logical practice, from the time we are little until we grow up, we learn lots of different mathematical terms to help our logic, to develop in a greater way, so later on as we encounter something, it requires logic or a thought process to judge. Then I think that will help a lot. So I think it is pretty good to combine both, not only a knowledge of the things we learn, but applying it, actually doing it in our lives. I do think it is important for us to learn the basics, even though we won't be able to use it in the future, it helps us to build up the way we think, helps us practice and then continue to move our brain, so our brain won't get rusty. And when we need to move it, it will actually move. reasonable.

Because there is no point to more food if the animals are disappearing. Those are not sea animals. Turtles, penguins, polar bears So they don't have a habitat, but their food resource actually grows  So if global warming only helps part of the bacteria, part of the foodhow can I say this; if global warming helps arctic animals to grow, but those animals are not food resources for polar bears, then there is no point in saying that global warming is actually helping arctic animals. It might be some, but not for all the animals, maybe not general speaking. This is just for specific types of animals. Only applies for specific marine animals¬ùAnd global warming is kind of like a cycle, there is no evidence to show. probably carbon dioxide is causing the temperature of the earth to grow, but that is not the only reason. scientific proof. What is this for? Sounds pretty professional. Have they tried it before? How long will it take for a rocket to arrive on Mars?  Has it ever succeeded to make it to mars? So have any rockets successfully completed their mission at all? This is a very good idea. Very ideal theory, but the problem is, are we able to do it? good ideas, wonderful plan is it doable? For this kind of case, it is very biased. Yes, it is true, especially in this world. People they expect to live in a higher quality of life, they need more money, so they are less likely to do a job that doesn't make as much as they need. Yeah, they need to pay more. emotional appealing by detail illustration of the work load of care takers lack of counter claim
