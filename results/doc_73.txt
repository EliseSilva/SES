 So it's an article from NPR.  So I will open another browser to look at this link. So I think this article is very reliable, because it's NPR news and I often use NPR to hear the news, and TED talks so I think it is pretty reliable. It is not 100% reliable but in my opinion. It's a 7, yes, it's a 7.  I think I'm going to open it. Let's see what I found. It's the first article. It's by just one person, so now I don't know how reliable it isno, it's actually pretty reliable. I mean I like articles with more than just one person.  I am just going to skim it really fast. It's not very long. So yeah, it's a good one for just having an overview of what is this problem. But here look at this other link. Clicks on link to Journal of Adolescent Health.  Now that I know that there is a research deeper in this study I can think reliable this article. So yes, now I think it is an 8 because it has the research, the other link, the source, and it's from the Journal of Adolescent Health, and I think it's pretty reliable. Sorry for my English by the way, I am not a native English speaker, but I will do my best to explain myself. Who is this Rebecca Hersher? Well she makes more articles. And not only on these kind of topics. So, she's not a specialist on the topic actually.  But she makes a lot of health research. This article is supported by another further investigation and has reliable sources like the Journal of Adolescent Health. Is made by one person who may have an understanding of the topic and has researched among many organizations such as the FDA. The writer of the article makes more news about different studies and a wide range of topics. There is no place that suggests me her academic studies and her experience on the topic. There is no reference list. But she has links, however there is no reference list.Okay, so let's see. HuffPost.. Hmmm. Not very sure. The article is A Third Way For Universities. I am not very sure how reliable is in my opinion. HuffPost is in my opinion not very reliable. It tends to have a lot of bias. It was made this year this article by Paula Wallace, President and Founder of Savannah College of Art and Design. So the writer of this article is President and Founder of a college so she must know what she's talking about. I like the writing style. She knows how to communicate really good her ideas. I would use her as a source, maybe not as my primary source but I think she is pretty reliable. I'm reading it really fast. I also like that the webpage doesn't have too many advertisements because when it has too much it means they are just for entertainment, for leisure. I also tend to watch the other articles like this part that says you may like because like when there are too many topics this is just a general page that talks about everything and talks about anything at the same time. I don't see any sources so I don't like this because people will ask ok she is saying this where are her sources. Okay here she is talking about Harvard Business Review that it's a review from someone, that doesn't make me feel that that's supporting, so I will actually think this is less, I will actually put a 4 in reliability. The writer of this article is a professional and a president of a college. This means she has certain knowledge on the topic. Didn't have any source cited or quoted. No extra links. Too much advertising in the webpage. She's just basing the article on her authority. And I don't like her because, well, she's the president of this college, but it doesn't say to me why I must believe her. The Blaze. Not a bad news portal. It's actually really good in my opinion, doesn't have too many bias. It's talking about a big topic like global warming. So let's check out how they made this. Here we have a hyperlink. There are so many ads about fashion. Here it has a little graph. It says that it is by NASA. I like The Blaze. I have a little bias with The Blaze, I will read it more than other kind of sources. But it is a news portal and sometimes the media informs or uninforms us. Ok I can see the graph. I can interpret the graph. USA Today, they are citing another news media. I don't like when news do that because they are like you say that, no you say that. If we go to USA Today maybe they are saying oh yes we said that, but we only said that because they said that. So they are passing the ball one to another and no one has the real source. Okay so let's see the external links.  I can see who made this article. PhD's I like this one because I can tell there is a further investigation. And they have more sources, and they have different graphs, so I like really much this source. Yeah, he has a lot of articles. I like this source. They have a big range of sources, they cite people who was masters in the topic, and reliable organizations such as NASA. Ads. I think this is a reliable source. I don't have anything against this source. I think is a good source.  So we have the Washington Post. That's a good news portal. This looks like an ad. To what extent we can consider that the Space X flight proven rocket it makes history. Who said that? For example, is it as big as when an astronaut landed in the moon. We haven't heard about that.  I really like the Washington Post, it has a little bit bias, but I'm going to give it a try. I will give this a 6. let's take a look at the video. What I'm doing is just watching the video really fast. I don't have too much time. I don't like this source at all because they are not giving me any source. They say only the facts that everyone knows. Who is Christian Davenport? I really like to watch who are the authors. Financial staff, so he's more of an accountant. No. Why he's talking about space and rockets if he has noI think this is more for learning, like, oh yes there was this rocket launched, it's not a really reliable source for a paper. It's just when I have free time and I want to read a nice article. Rates it a 2. It has a video that proves what he is talking about. The writer is not a specialist on the topic. Too much ads. No sources cited. No additional links. Just a news for entertainment. Daily Kos, I haven't heard about this news portal before, so I don't know what to expect. It says here republicans and democrats, so they tend to don't have so much bias.  Surveys are not very reliable, but they still have the link about that survey.  They are talking about Washington Post. It is another news source and we have discussed about Washington Post and I don't really like it. So this is like another webpage news portal that doesn't seem that reliable to me. So let's take a look. Who is writing. Laura Clawson, editor. She is a journalist. Sees Laura's Most Frequent Tags and Donald Trump has the highest number. She talks about politics, a lot of politics. She likes a lot of political stuff. So why are you talking about crisis in care? Well because health is also important when we talk about politics. Is a really short article. I don't like that because when there are good studies you don't have short articles. It has lots of comments; comments are not most of the time useful. I don't like all these articles at the bottom, this one is how to lose weight in ten seconds, so I don't like additional articles. I like the picture. It gives me an idea of what she is going to talk about.  Ok so we have here a pdf but it is not a long pdf, it is only 4 pages. And also this pdf is just for giving information and has a lot of bullet points and reliable sources like medical journals, doesn't have bullet points to talk about the article. And has lots of doctors. Ok so who wrote this pdf. This is a report by Wisconsin Healthcare Association.  But this is for general public, is not for professionals. Goes back to WP link. We have talked about WP and WP is talking about a survey. Statistics. Statistics are not actually that reliable. So yeah, it has a 4 here and it still has a 4. I don't think it's reliable. More reliable:The journalist has made a lot of articles regarding this topic and regarding politics. She has experience on this. She also quotes other sites. It is relying on a secondary source which is not 100% reliable. Short article, the external sources are not professionals, just for the general public.
