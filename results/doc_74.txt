Is it just news? Hmm.  Weird.  A realpublisher?  That's weird.  I mean I guess you just, don't  Goes back to survey.  'Heard onheard on All Things Considered' I guess an excerpt from something someone said somewherenot really published yeah I don't know this person. The nation's leading group of obstetricians and gynecologists but they don't reference the actual group so I can't go back and look atthe real group? Makes me wonder like, how credible the source really is, if they don't even reference the actual group that did the study.  It's very vague.  'We wrote about it and everything.'  yeah. I'd like to see some reference.  Like, they reference the laws in California and Oregon but I'd like to see some sort of number referencing the actual law so I can go and look at it. That just kinda statement?  Krishna Upadhya assistant professor, pediatrics at John Hopkins university school of medicine.  Lead author of the reviewthe reviewjournal of adolescent healthInteresting!  So I mean, this is kinda a good source.  I would almost not evenI'd credit the source for pushing me THIS source But that's about it.  I mean  Complete quotes and reference.  Tags to the original sources. I want to see some sort of specificity.  Specifics. No Publisher.  No resource links/quotes. It's kind of halfly done here, but yeah.  I mean maybe a three I probably wouldn't use this for a paper.  Just because it lacks a publisher.  And then the credibility just kind of goes out the window from there.  Unless it's someone that is very well known for their work in this line of field.  No publisher, it means someone else didn't really publish it.  Especially on the website. The website just kind of looks like news?  Different things and news so I mean it's almost like this article feels halfly done. Oh screen shots yeah 3. Okay updated.  Oh that's nice.  There's a picture of the author, although I can't really see it it's a contributor.  President and founder college of art and design. Hmm!  Um from oh  Opens a new tab and goes searches huffingtonpost. Huffington Post!  Great  Yep hahahaha.  Not the most credible source for news.  I'm afraid to say.  A lot of times they're just more gossip news but I meanat least they're a lot better than this one right? They're more credible in my opinion than someone that I've never been to, and doesn't even have a publisher.  They tend to do things better?  But they're not alwaysas good.  Generation z. yeah that's a bit obscure.  So a reference to Steve Jobsa reference to CNN Fareed Zakaria?  It looks to be structured pretty well.  Savannah College of Art and Design okay so that's who, the contributor is from.  1978 so I mean, it's referencing different resource different studies it's done.  I'd still like to see like, the tags are nice, that's great, umm I'd still like to see more quotes and things from those people.  So I can actually go research those people.  Like I said before Huffington Post is ehhhit's better,  it's just not as good so this is maybe something I'd include, but maybe a snippet here or there.  Um but honestly I would include more of where they referenced to then I would them, just because I like to go to individual studies rather than a blog site.  Huffington Post isthey have some good newsand they're getting better, butnotorious in the past for justfake news.  Just gossip, really.  So I mean  about a 5. Nice resource tag. It's nice I can go and look up those people and those places and see what they had to say and what they included in here just to make sure they're not manipulating anything.  Like, Steve Jobs is well known, CNN is very well known.  Harvard business reviewso I mean Michael D. Kingfrom Harvard. Yeah Harvard's great for this.  Umm credibility like just looking at it I would say it looks about to be a good credible source  it's got a person tagged to it from this place, it's got the date published, what time zone it's published in, which is a lot ummwhich I mean doesn't really matter but it's nice to have.  And 'updated,' the last time it was updated is very nice as well.  So I mean looking at the source, it's a 7.  Now the fact that it's on Huffington Postwould push me down to a 5, just because Huffington Post has that credibility for sometimes having just gossip news.  IyeahI've seen a lot of gossip news on it, anyway, and it's hard to find a place without gossip news, today, so Nice resource tags. Nice layout with structured content. Those are things with this one that make it more reliable to me, even though it is on Huffington Post. Huffing Post is known for gossip news. And thenI didn't see a publisher, probably because it's just half the article, I believe, yeah it's cut off, so I mean the publisher could probably be at the bottom. Right about here, and I do see it on'The Huffington Post is a registered trademark of The Huffington Post.com, Inc.  All rights reserved.  Part of HuffPost “ HPMG Neews.'  I mean so I can't really discredit them for that.  Butyeah it's up there the only thing is Huffington Post you gotta be careful on.  It's kinda, it's kinda like somewhere you'd wanna start basing, but not somewhere you'd wanna have your entire research on.  Just because it isit's okay. The BlazeI've never heard of the Blaze. Huh.  So it's got the regular just ads on the side.  Facebook share and tweet for twitter is so common nowadays.  Caption for the picture.  Huh!  That's nice.  And then author, and then the date is published.  Exact time, that's nice.  Hmmm.  Starts reading silently.  Whoa.  They lost me in the first paragraph.  It's one long run-on sentence pretty much.  So yeah.  I mean looking at it, caption: great.  Author: great.  The title is a bit wordya LOT of ads on the side.  Um but the first paragraph just completely lost my attention. University of Southern DenmarkUniversity of Southern Denmark? I assume that's a place you can go look.  Let's go Blaze. 'Authentic, unfiltered, fearless.'  okay so it just looks like another Huffington Post to me. 'TheBlaze, INC'.'constitues your acceptance oh for friends of the Blaze.'  Huh.  So there's just a bunch of writers writing different things on news.  There's a chart!  That's nice.  'Source: NASA!'  That is nice!  Reference to NASA  yup!  Okay.  So I meansome good resources here.  So actually, I would put this one up there.  Yeah. That's something I might use.  It's not uh yeah hesitant! Just looking at it  seven I'd put it probably at a 7.  But the fact that website just looked TOTALLY bloggy  puts me at a 5.  I mean, the chart's nice, from NASA, and doing things from NASA, yeah, it's great.  A caption, a person, I know who the publisher is, when they published this.  First paragraph; way wordy.  It kinda just lost my attention, so skipping past that, yeah, there's some good information.  So overall Nice references to accredible  source. And then Complete information on publisher, author, etc. So those are nice. Website looks like a blog site/Huffington Post. Website looks like a blog site. Wordy title and introduction. There we go.  I'd better get moving quick. Okaywhere is that?  The Washington Post.  Okay.  They are very credible, so just looking at itokay so there's a video of the ACTUAL launch.  The person, the date.  Now I'd like to have the time but I can deal without it.  Caption for this.  Okay structured very well.  I mean  Okay, THAT caught my attention.  Now I wanna know more, and I'm definitely gonna read the rest.  So over-viewing this  This is a quote, sweet.  Nice quote fromI can't quite tell Gwynne Shotwell, Space X president.  So, Elon Musk's Space X makes history by launching a 'flight-proven' rocket.' Nice.  Just the overall '-esque' of it, I mean, ads on the side; yes, but hardly any.  It doesn't look like a blog post at all.  So right off the bat this is something being a 9.  There is a couple of things like, no date, I mean a date but no time, c'mon really you can at least include the time. Ummm so.  Just from my past experience with the Washington Post, great.  They're very structured, the layout is justsomething that I amit feels more structured, and because of that, it gives me a better 'esque' to it.  Now seeing some weird news just right about here  I guess visual stories.  So this is kind of like your gossip news right here, section of gossip news.  Maybe bring it down to an 8, but  1996 to 2017.  They they've been here very long.  And because of that, they're very credible.  And all these different links down here at the bottom help me to say 'huh, I want to use this more often.'  So, down here, maybe an 8 because they do have gossip news, but  looking at the sources. Highly relieable quotes and sources for the article.  Reliable website with ten plus years of experience.  Nice resource tags and original video.  Structured well. So honestly, looking at it I'd say a 10.  Very reliable.  I could rely on this.  Ehh looking through the website there are some things that I don't really like.  Puts me down to a 9. Some gossip news/informal news on the website. That's a little bit, I mean yeah.  It's what it is. Daily Kosh uh.  Looking at navigation tabs at top of page They have republicans, democrats, science, elections, politics, environment, media, Obamacare Obamacare isn't  and they're all hashtags!  GOP, 2018, Russian they have. not that many ads, just links to other websites?  Huh. That title is just a bit wordy.  Lauren  Clawson.  Yay, they gave me the time! Monday, April 24th, 2017 at AM Mountain Daylight Time.  There's comments on it that's interesting. Okay so  attribution tagged to the imaging placement.  I'd really like to see a caption, and a tag to the author.  I mean, the photographer.  That would be a lot betterin my case.  Starts reading through the article.  Okay, I see there point.  This sentence right here is kind ofwhoa  Ohhhit's just a pictureoh yeah, you guys took a screenshot.  Gotcha.  Ha!  Just that sentence there.  I usually like to evaluate by first paragraph whether or not I'm actually gonna use it, just because first paragraph can tell me a LOT about what it's going to say.  So good caught my attention, not as much as say the Washington Post one, though.  Comparatively.  So I'd use that one overthe one from here probably. It may just be the author too.  'One survey discovered.'  Wisconsin One survey discovered  What survey? Tell me the survey!  Manso overall looking, it looks to be pretty decentI mean 8, right off the bat  a decent Give me the survey please!  I'd like to look that uptag it somewhere! okay.  Daily Kos, I don't know that website so goes to his second tab and searches for daily kos. Kose?  Koss? Daily Koss? Daily Kose? So an article just right off the backanother article so it's article after article, you can see, oh that's funny.  There's some other work than articles here, that's nice.  Obviously you can attribute to I guess more style. yeah it doesn't seem bad to me.  Oh come onscroll!  Scroll like you mean it! Okay, yep.  Kos Media.  I wish they'd give me a date.  How long they've been here.  That takes it down a little.  But, I mean, the overall layout doesn't look gossipy.  It looks like a good news website, especially with the layout of the website.  Like they actually had a professional come and do their website.  Or they probably paid a good amount. So after looking at it, I can agree.  It's an 8. Good looking and easy to navigate website.  Some tagged sources.  Caught my attention. How long they have been around? SOME tagged sources.  Structured well. Back to LESS box: Wordiness. I assume I have likeone more?  Okay. Domain, I did not mention the domain.  Um nowadays I don't think it matters as much but that is something you like to look at for credibility. A lot of these sources probably weren't peer reviewed just because they were just news. I do love a peer reviewed source from a scholarly database though.  That would put a 10.  It'd be up there with the Washington Post news, just because Washington Post, a credible, 1997 all the way to 2017 was the 20 years I mean orgive or take 20 years.  So, very acredible.  Having a date Eh that doesn't matter to me.  I could I could not care less if I agree, or disagree.  I'm using this as a source to either prove my point, or to argue against.  So no.  That one, not really. The rest of them, ye- well, currency of facts Kind of.  I mean, if it's something in the present day I want it to be current.  But, if it's something referencing later I mean, yeah kind of. And then otherlength of Publication source in business so what I mean by that is what I was looking for, like Washington Post 20 years has been in business. The other places didn't really list how long they've been there, how long they've had their copyright, or how long they've had a publication source or published things.  I mean the first source didn't even have a publication source, soyeah.  That matters to me, how long they've been there. Yeah with every source.  Every source. So that's my mindset.  Just overview ofI like things to be complete.  And when things aren't complete, it makes the source lose credibility.  Especially if it has something like, tons of ads on the side. like this one doesn't, but, like tons of different ads, rather than links to just different articles that they have.  The structure of the website.  Just little things that make a big difference in weather or not I'll actually use, the source.  It's just completeness.  Having a completelike tags in the article.  Tags to authors, tags to photographers.  Full captions, not just where they got it from but what it's about.  Um source videos, if they provide a video.  Video from the source, not just a link of a link of a link of a link.  Links to actual like surveys and things that are done, links to other websites that have those surveys in them, and then links to the surveys themselves, is great.  Just a lot of different things that I look into when evaluating a source.  Just because whenit's not only the content but how acredible the people are creating the content, like if they've been in there 20+ years, yeah, I'm gonna look at them and probably use them.  If I don't know how long they've been in there and they don't look credibleprobably not going to use them.  And if they look credible but don't have how long they've been in thereI'll look into it.  And I might tag just a line or two of theirs.  But um yeah that's generally my thought process.
