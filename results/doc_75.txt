Okay so, NPR is pretty trusted news source, so, I think it is reliable, at the same time it doesn't really explain like how the research was done, or the results.  And so, it's not clear why adolescents are at a greater risk. But they do have a quote from a professor at John Hopkins University, which has a really good medical program, so that adds reliability.  Okay I'm just going to go to NPR and look at the website. I'll go to health. There seem to be It is just a news though, it's not published from the University, the John Hopkins University, it is just like, a news website.  So they might not know exactly what they're talking about. Sets 2nd slider to 5. NPR is a trusted news site and they have a quote form a professor at one of the top medical schools in the country.  It's pretty good. It was not published by the university so it was not written by the researchers.  The research process is not described and does not explain why contraceptives are not harmful to teens.  It focuses more on the political side of the issue.

'Content is provided by the school' Well this is so hard I don't know I'm going to give it a 5 she does on 2nd slider because it seems like a very successful school for the arts but I can't find any like, outside information about this school. Paula Wallace was the founder of the school, and according to the school website 98% of their students are employed in the arts.  She includes the results of her personal students.  (Has experience)The college is not ranked, and it was hard to find any outside information about it.  All the information I read was provided by the school. The Blaze is very Republican  Okay University of Southern Denmark. Accompanies? That's random. Ice levels are declining. It includes studies by a university that is ranked in the top two hundred world wide. That's not even that good The Blaze is a very right slanted news source politically, which tend to be against the idea that global warming is a big issue that needs to be resolved.

With political analysis on US current events from a liberal perspective. And Laura Clawson. Is the labor editor, Daily Kos Laborbut like, who is she? That's a good college.  Princeton.  Huh.  Okay. Back to survey.  So I trust her a little bit more because she has a PhD in sociology from an Ivy League school, and has taught at a university.  So I'd do  I trust her more.  But it's still a blog. Okay.  Ummm. The author has a phd in sociology from an Ivy League school, and has taught at Princeton and Dartmouth. It has statistics from administrations who work in healthcare and nursing home settings. What is that actually? Social problems.  This would be a social problem I think. It is a blog post, and the website leans left politically. It does not say how increasing Medicaid funding would help the problem necessarily. Oh yeah I forgot to check that but that's important. Yeah cause usually websites with a lot of random advertising tends to be like blogs and things. Yeah oh I forgot to check that too dangit.  Butedu is definitely better than .org.
