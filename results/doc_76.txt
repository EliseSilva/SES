I'd put like a 7 because NPR is pretty reliable source, and they have sources like the professor from Johns Hopkins University. I'm going to rate overall reliability like an 8 because they were backing up their, what they're saying, they're providing sources, and but also like the people giving the information aren't experts themselves, and also it's like a radio station, so I'm going to give it an 8. They provide good sources to back up their statements. They report on medical issues. It is a radio station website which means the hosts are not experts in the medical field and although the back up what they say it would be more reliable for me if it was a website more medically know. So first of all, this is a Huff Post article, so that makes me a little bit skeptical, since pretty much anyone can post a article about anything they really want. It says that she's president and founder of Savannah College of Art and Design, so that, she should be like pretty educated on this whole topic, but also she could be really biased about it. She's seems like she is probably including a little bit of her opinion and also I'm usually pretty skeptical of websites that are putting out news articles that have these kinds of ads on the side. I just feel like often if it has these kinds of ads, a lot of the time it's just clickbait. So I'm going to give it like a 5, just because she's giving her opinion, and it's not like the most reliable news source. So she sounds like she's pretty legit. A little bit more skeptical about this particular source, Huff Post, because these kinds of articles on the side, so like if it was CNN or a news source instead of having 3 foods to avoid in 2017a related article at the bottom, it's, there's a lot that, it's not super reliable. And it's, I feel like the Huff Post is one of those websites that really likes for you to share what they've got. So they've got the little widgets on the side and here they've got this  It's just not the most formal and reliable news source. So I think overall reliable and credibility, I'm probably going to give it like a 3, because I haven't read, or no, I'll give it like a 4, because I've read some articles on Huff Post that have been really good and backed up by good sources and all of those things, but some of the Huff Post articles are just kind of people ranting.  Sometimes the articles are backed up by good sources.Like I was saying earlier, like not being the most reliable, it's got a lot of people. A lot of people are just sharing their opinions about certain topics and it's kind of hard to pick out which ones are really reliable and which ones are people just ranting about something they might not know that much about. So this one looks a lot like Huff Post. I don't know who Justin Haskins is, I mean, he could be anyone. I, there's not like any explanation of who this author is. That's kind of a big red flag to me immediately. I don't like, I can't say that this source is reliable because I don't have any evidence that this guy knows what he's talking about. Also it's got all the clickbait-type ads. Like he seems to have some good sources, researchers, and he's got this highlighted, so I'm guessing that that's going to take me to a link explaining the study that the researchers of University of Southern Denmark did. He's got a professor; he seems to have like pretty okay sources. Like I would think that they're pretty reliable. So like I have no idea who he is. Global warming fail. I feel like global warming just one of those things that people just like to rant about. Like I have no idea if he knows what he's talking about. He's got this whole chart here. I think I'm probably going to give it like a 3.  I just, he's got some pretty lit sources to back himself up, but I think the big thing for me is just the overall look of it and how it's got all these clickbait ads on the side. Just the fact that I don't really know who this guy is. So the first one I go, I got to figure out who this guy is. Well, he's got 3 followers on twitter and it looks like he's not really writing about. He does have a lot of articles about climate change, but I still am really skeptical of who this guy is, because he seems to have a lot of pretty controversial things, which could be just a random thing in, there's some stuff that's not even related to climate change, like this one and this one, it just seems kind of random. And I still have no indication of how he is a reliable source. He has 3 followers, so I'm guessing he's not this super big person in media type things. But I'm not really, I'm not super familiar with the blaze, so it looks kind of like one of those websites that people can write whatever they want.It seems like one of those, yeah, talk about anything  share breaking news. Create a story, speak your mind.So yeah, it seems like this is not a super reliable source. There's like Chris j kemp, 21 rainman  It doesn't really seem like these are super reliable people. Peachtart@juno.com. I wouldn't be comfortable trusting peach tart or whatever news they are. Are these they were, sharing, it, just the appearance of the website itself, and how there's all of this discussion at the bottom. It kind of reminds of me like a facebook feed, and it's an immediate turn off because a lot of the time it's just people, talking about stuff they have no idea about. I don't feel like this is a super reliable source. I think overall I'll probably give it like a 2 because people could do their research. They could definitely have good sources but since it is kind of like, again, one of those websites. Good sources could be a thing to back up claims.It just doesn't seem like it's super reliable like. Anyone can post an article on this website regardless of whether they are an expert or not. It's not super reliable because anyone can just go on and share what they think and a lot of people won't click on links they kind of just take everything at face value and this doesn't seem to a website that I would go to for news coverage about anything important.It kind of just seems like one of those websites that I would go to if I had an opinion about something, and I wanted to find someone who felt the same way I did. So this already seems like a more reliable source, it's the Washington Post, it's got a video. So that's pretty good. Looks like they've got pretty good sources. It looks like they've done their research. It looks like they have a link to say who Christian Davenport is.  It's probably not Not really sure what's going on. I don't really think this is one of those websites where you just anyone can post. So I'm going to give it like a 9. Because Washington Post, that's a real newspaper. And like it looks here like subscribe, so this is a legit news source. And it's not like where you can be like, I just want to post something that I think as. They've got a lot of different, this is a like a real newspaper. They have the opinion editorial, sports, local, nation, like they have definitely much more reliable than any of the other sources so far.So this one, looks like All right, Christian Davenport, he's a reporter, Washington DC. He's a reliable source. He's been working for the newspaper for a while. It looks like This is a pretty good source. Not really sure what section this one would be under But it seems like it's a pretty good source. It's got the ads. I feel like I would definitely trust this more than like a Huff Post article. Because it's like a legitimate thing. I'm going to give it a 10. This is a real news source with real journalists who report for a living and I would trust this more than a Huffpost article or something like that.Overall makes it less reliable. Reporters aren't perfect, there could still be some bias. Overall I would trust this news source. Yeah, I have no idea what this is. I don't think I've ever heard of this website. So that automatically makes me kind of hesitant to trust what it's talking about. Also, all of the subjects or topics that they have at the top are hashtags, which doesn't really seem like a super reliable source would do that. Like if I wanted to look up stuff with hashtags, I'd just go to twitter. This again seems like one of those websites, I have no idea who Laura Clawson is, looks kind of like her picture is a selfie. I'm not sure, I can't really tell. But other jpmassar, zentrainer, like it doesn't really seem like these people who are writing these articles are reliable sources. I'm probably going to give it like a . because Huff Post, a lot of it is opinion, but there is some stuff to back it up, but I've never even heard of this website.I have no idea. Um, Okay, yeah, this does not seem reliable to me at all. Immediately when I get on it asks me to sign a petition.There's a lot of  there's just. Here's Laura Clawson again, I'm not really sure who she is. But it really seems like it it's kind of, there's a lot of people on here. So she's actually like staff of this place. It, so she, she's actual staff, she's been here since 2006. It's still really feels like it's really more of an opinion place. So it says Laura Clawson is on the staff, but all I got was that she's on the staff. Doesn't really seem like she's super reliable. Cause I don't really know anything about her or this website, so for all I know, she could be like anyone who they just, she could be a person who started posting articles, and they were like, we kind of like the way that she thinks, so we're going to hire her.  Really none. I've never heard of this news source and a lot of reliable news sources are commonly seen (CNN, BBC, NBC, etc).  You don't get any background on the author just that she is staff at this website but I have a hard time believing anything I might see because I have no idea what her credentials are.  Also the hastags are kind of throwing me off at the top.  It doesn't seem like a formal or professional website.
