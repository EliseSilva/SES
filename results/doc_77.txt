Health news from NPR. Is there a url? What website is it from?  Dot org. Reliability. I'll give it a 6. It refers to comments made by an renown doctor/professor from a more credible source. If it was published by an accredited medical journal or association I would be more likely to trust it. I tend to not listenWho is Rebecca Hersher? She's just a writer. All about health news. Well, largely, but I guess.Trying to see who the writer is. If I I could remember my password. There we go. Slightly annoying I can't tell if that's a hill. This isn't worth it. She receives her international reporting fellowship, 2015. National public radio.Second tab? Second tab I'm assuming would be. The text? Huff Post. Is Huff Post like the Huffington Post. I'm going to rate it a 4. This is basically the same as the last one. It is written by the founder of a college. It is published by a media company that may just want to make money for some group.So not really reading this article completely through, but it's about, it seems to be about, A Third Way for Universities. They're just a media company; I don't like media companies. That's funny. This just seems like a really conservative post or media company. Finally Hillary's vicious plan to overthrow Trump caught on video. Seems like it's fairly conservative. I do like the numbers, that come directly from NASA. I would quote those.I'll give it a 6. More Numbers and Data from NASA are what I like. I don't like that it is probably a biased media company with an audience that is primarily conservative, (I presume). Even though I am conservative, I don't want biased info or sources that lack credibility.I'll give it a 5 actually , just looking at the first screenshot. Okay, the Washington Post. Wow, I don't like any of these. I do like Elon Musk. I'll give this a 6. Washington Post. I already know I don't believe half the things they say. It is reporting on an event that happened with video support and commentary from the CEO of the company. I like that. I don't like the Washington Post for one. Their credibility fled when they began marketing on SnapChat and letting amateur writers plug their biased opinions into every article without Let's see if they have anything. Washington Post. Trump says who wanted Comey out. Washington Post. In a letter he said.That seems pretty straightforward. Four reasons Trump something works.  Analysis something White House. At least Trump has a something. A 180 on that. Whether or not I agree with this article. Democracy dies in darkness. Dies with misinformation. Like the Washington Post. without backing up their often outrageous claims. I don't have any specific examples to back that up, but that is the vibe that has been my experience. Two, they are just in it for the money like everyone else it seems. Well, I'm on a rant. Just so we're clear, I'm not a huge fan of the media. I don't know if I've made that clear yet. Articles by the Washington Post, and things like that, I tend to stay away from because I don't really trust the writers, I don't really trust the direction they get because really the incentives that they have are, for writing articles is just about the money. I think they have a flawed view, they romanticize, they give too much importance to getting information out, they don't realize the harm they cause by getting bad information out, or even just getting information out that people don't need to hear. So in general, maybe I'm biased, but I don't like these sort of sources. But I would still use them, I just don't love them. Daily Kos. I'm really not.. Daily kos.Daily weblog with political analysis on current events from a liberal perspective. Oh, that's like devastating, says right there that it's biased.I don't like it when it's biased in either direction.I just want the facts, ignore the commentary. I'll give it a 5 because they openly admit to having bias. Overall what good qualities. It is typed neatly. What makes it more reliable? What makes it more reliable? Links to one survey. They openly view the news from a liberal perspective. To me that says bias. I'm more interested in the higher-level things.
