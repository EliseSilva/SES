What? So I made it a 10 because I think NPR is a very trusted radio site. I guess they are doing online articles now. Also the facts in the article are stating what California and Oregon have done legally and you can't skew it online. For such a big company if you were to mess up what laws the states passed you could get in trouble for that. They do quote a professor from Johns Hopkins University which has a good medical school. They just provide good medical background that adds onto the authority of the quotes and facts that they are drawing from. I am trying to find websites that prove NPR's credibility then I'd also have to figure out the credibility of those websites. But, I mean, I think NPR is just at the point that they are so big that if they weren't citing credible sources then they'd get in trouble. This source is more reliable to me because it's NPR. That's my main indicator. I don't now. So it's not that I don't believe the credibility or reliability of this website. I think HuffingtonPost is actually a fantastic website. I always stumble upon this website all the time Googling random things for no reason. I've always found their website to be reliable. I guess I've never read a huffington post article and asked myself how reliable or credible it is, but there's nothing that has ever ticked me off saying this doesn't seem right. If we were to ask if this article is 100% true or something this seems like a personal experience or editorial to me; he's just talking about how colleges should offer more programs. I think it's a reliable source, it's a good opinion and it's very well stated and she has a sense of authority. She helped create a college of art and design which is awesome. I don't know how much work you'd put into making a design program but she seems legit to me. That it's Huffington Post honestly. If I were looking at facts, this article doesn't prove much because it is simply an opinion paper. So I've never heard of The Blaze.  Just the wording Global warming fail. That's kind of slangy in my head so I immediately discredited it. Even after reading the first paragraphs I was like no, animals have to be, what's the word, dying out, extinct, up there because they don't have that land mass to live on and they weren't made to swim like the polar bear. But then it gets more and more legitimate. They have studies by the University of Southern Denmark. But more than that they have the press release that. I actually am encountering some counterarguments. There is a typo in here that kind of concerns me. But they even released data from NASA and they have a graph on there. I guess anyone can make a graph. It says it's from NASA so I'm going to believe it. I'm going to look it up. So I just typed in theblaze.com just to see what kind of a news source it is. It seems like a really modern news source. The wording they use as titles. Maybe that's to draw in a younger crowd which is fair. It seems legit. the press release statements and the graph at the end. the typo accompanies the title is slangy “ 'global warming fail'. I'm going to say this again, but it's the Washington Post so I'm going to trust it. I guess I'm realizing that a lot of my feelings about reliability come from not just the source, but the main provider of the source. So like the Huffington Post, the Washington post. They all sound legit to me because I know and trust those websites as news sources. The Blaze I had never heard of. But once I looked it up I realized it is a real news source that is reliable, so. What I'm just noticing is the source it comes from. So I don't know, every time I look up the article or check its credibility through this second tab I don't really know what I'm looking for. Because I guess I don't really know how to look up credibility. I do know if a website sounds fake enough, or an article sounds fake enough you can actually Google it and just say 'is this article real?' and it will show up if its false. But when it's websites this big I don't know how to do that. So I'm just looking at the websites to see if the article really exists. This article has a video to go along with it. And it's NASA. You can only lie so much is my point of view, but I'm a college student who knows nothing so don't take my word for that, but, ok. The fact that I's the Washington post, it has a video, facts from NASA. The second thing I'm noticing is that even if I don't know the website source it's coming from, I do look at the grammar, structure, or the way they write their papers. Because I think only a skilled writer would know to put in personal stories and facts and kinda have a point of view, or sense of character. They put these good tidbits of information in here. The way it's structured does show to me that it's a reliable/credible article. Once again I've never heard of Daily Kos K-O-S. It seems legitimate. Also these share links at the bottom to facebook/twitter I guess that doesn't prove anything but you like to share things that you see that are legit, so. I barely looked at their website but I trusted it. It seems more like an opinion website. Well, that's a lie. It seems like opinion editorials with a lot of facts in them, so I guess it's just a really backed up opinion. The amount of quotes and the structure of the whole article. unknown news source. Oh I didn't check when they published it. Oh I did check the sources site. I'm dumb! I did check the writer's authority or background. I didn't really pay attention to the design of the website. I don't' know if it really speaks to me unless it's messy. I do trust advertising in articles. I did notice it earlier, but I didn't say that. It just seems like they are sponsored. People like them. I didn't pay attention to the domain types here, but if it is .edu I trust it. How I found the soure. So when it comes to Google it depends on how much I trust it. But when it comes to the BYU library database I just know that it's going to be true because it's a research library. I'm trying not to base my emotional responses on reliability. If I have an opinion that's not going to interfere with the facts that they have. Or ar trying to use to back up their argument.  So I don't really check credibility or reliability unless it's a website that sounds out there or something just seems off about it. Like earlier when I said you could google it. I know that's not the best way to go about it but it works for me. Usually I get 5-10 links just from the screenshot that I saw here that would say the article isn't true or it's a hoax. When I see so many websites dedicated to the false article I don't believe it's a real article. And sometimes it's reading to want”it's interesting to read the articles that claim that the article isn't true. They point out little things that prove it's not true. Or they will follow who the article is about. They'll follow up with them with a quote that says I just did it for fun, or it was dumb, or it's not true, or it was true to a point. I think if you want to find out if a source is true or not you can. It's a lot easier to find an article that's not true and trust that it's not true because so many websites are dedicated to cracking down on those kind of things. As far as if a source is credible, if it comes from a big enough website or a famous enough authority than I just believe it's true. If it sounds within my common sense to then I just don't question. I think that's it.
