Initially my question about this article are who else are the quoting for these medical facts, this research. They have one down here, some professor at Johns Hopkins which is a pretty credible source but it seems that her quote doesn't have the same authority as the other ones. Hers just talks about that there is a growing body of evidence that shows that the safety risks are low and the benefits are large but up here. when there is no source for the quotes these are more powerful. Researchers say that there is no evidence they are using that absolute no but that's not something that this lady down here says. I might say reliability I think a 7. 7 because it does have a professor from Johns Hopkins but I don't know, there is some ambiguity about the other facts they present. So here is the exact article that I was given. Here we see that they are quoting Johns Hopkins again. Here she is even saying that it is safer for these younger teens. There's much, maybe I'll find a different source and take out some information So I'm choosing this one right here, Johns Hopkins Medicine.org to try to see if they were maybe misrepresenting what this professor had said. I mean according to this it seems like what they were saying was actually they were representing what she said pretty well so probably maybe give it a 9 or 10 after this. I give it a 9 because a 10 would be perfect and I don't know what a perfect source here would be. begins more/less reliable questions. A credible source. Johns Hopkins is a well known medical university.Initially, just that not all the facts and statistics were supported by sources. So I didn't finish reading the whole thing but I'd say just by glancing over it briefly that this one is pretty reliable although the speaker and even the college I've never heard of. But the fact that he or she is speaking as the president of this college implementing this strategy about which they're speaking give some reliability to them I'd say. They are talking about something they have tried and have proven works. I don't really know what I would search to find more information about this. It seems like if I searched a third way for universities that I would be taken to this very article and I don't know enough about the problem at hand here in the beginning to formulate another question. I suppose I can search savannah college of art and design. I think that's how you spell savannah. Oh I did it right They got their stuff on lockdown. I'll have to see if there is a different one.  One thing I'm considering here too is it sounds like the debate here is between whether career specific education (so for engineers just math and science) not have them worry about history or humanities of any kind. And then the opposite being true as well. If someone's going into humanities not make them take any math or science classes. But it sounds like this specific art university has found a middle ground. That's just what I'm gathering from looking at the rather artistic webpage. The author is speaking from her personal experience.  Although I have not ever heard of this college of this president, her speaking from her experience gives her credibility.  'I tried this new thing and look how well it works' Maybe just that I don't know that much about this college.  If it were Harvard, or Yale, no one would question that this method does indeed work.  But seeing as I do not know anything about Savannah College, it could be that they only have 500 students with very limited interests and career paths thus disqualifying them from being able to apply this strategy over a wider range of professions.Alight-y I can already tell this is going to be a hot button controversial topic. Maybe something that someone would have a great need to try to prove. A lot of people are trying to prove that global warming is not happening that it is. So this could be an area for a high probability for I guess incorrect information. Or at least un-credible information.  Well. I mean based upon this article they haveI mean I assume the University of Southern Denmark is a real thing and would be credible. They do cite their source for this information. Which is that global warming is better for these artic animals. I have to go 8 on this one though just because I don't know. I think for me another chart would help. If they showed a chart of how the increased temperatures over the last 16 years or 17 years or so how it shows that there is more algae and how because of that there is more food for marine creatures. So I am going to search maybe positive global warming effects. Searches positive global warming effects on search bar and clicks on first result, titled Consequences of global warming  3 critical impacts edf.org. This looks like it's going to be talking about the cons. This one seems to be saying contrary information so I'll probably glance at this. At least that's what I'm lead to believe showing a creature that's generally associated with living in the arctic Arctic and arctic regions, ok. Arctic animals. So we are talking about the North Pole. See look at this hereAs there is less ice they literally have less place to live. So here it looks like based upon this article, paragraph, the algae and bacteria are accustomed to the temperatures of the arctic. And as they change a little bit they are highly sensitive that they leave, they go elsewhere, and the whole food chain is negatively impacted in that area. Maybe after further review I would say that this one is less credible. I'm thinking that they are only showing a small tunnel vision approach about what is actually going on here. Maybe to some extent having more like it said, some kind of melt-ponds. Sometimes having more of those does help but once you go past that point it's detrimental. I'm acting under the assumption that SDU is a credible source. After further review the given article could only be showing us a keyhole view of the situation. Another source told me the exact opposite information about algae and bacteria growth in warmer arctic waters. But who knows, maybeI feel like in general with research you can take any data and construe it any way you want to to prove your point. This is a difficult one. Just based upon the other article I read I might say that upon further review the given article could only be showing us a keyhole view of the situation. Interesting article. Maybe I'll search reusable spacecraft Rocket. Maybe I'll change spacecraft for Rocket There we go.  So I mean I'm looking at this one now. This is the website for this specific company that we are talking about here. And it seems that the article is correctly representing their claims. Just like the article says, it doesn't make sense to use an airplane only once. We might as well find a way to make rockets more than once. It would cut down on costs. I think it would be cool to see a picture of this thing landing. Huh. That is crazy. There are some crazy things happening to make this possible. That is pretty cool. Well they got it right. I'm going to give this one a 10 because I think it's cool. As opposed to a 9. Because a 9 would be not as cool. By comparing with another source all the fact and claims check out!Same thing by comparing with another source all the facts and claims check out. I can't think of any.I don't know I guess I didn't see a whole lot about this that was shaky. I mean a lot was quotation from various scientists for this space X company, I guess that only thing uncredible about would be if were proven to be not true. I saw a video about it I mean that was pretty cool but it could have been photo shopped. What qualities make it less reliable? I don't know. I can't think of any. Oops did I forget to answer this one? I did. I would say maybe I'd give it an 8 before hand before I was able to check it out back check it. Yeah. For me this gets initial higher credibility points. I am from Wisconsin so this close to home  Somethings like this you wonder if it's an institutional change that needs to take place or a change of virtue that needs to take place. American heritage one thing that we talked about a lot and this might just be another negative outcome of society moving farther from God. People having less accountability for their parents. Maybe not necessarily their parents but the elderly.  But that's not what we are examining here. This seems like a pretty real thing. What would anyone stand to gain from making stuff up about this other than trying to support government healthcare? I would say that this is pretty high creditably/reliability for me But I don't really know what to search here. I feel like if I were to search something related to this that a million things could come up and it would tell me the same thing. And also for sake of time I might just bypass this one. Reliable because it has testimonial of someone negatively impacted by such a small labor force in this area. I can't think of anything here either. I mean I didn't even look at this but that would be a good thing to look for. This for sure This is something I commented on  whether or not I know of this person before or have heard of this personI would say that bad advertising on the website negatively affects me. I was just looking at that last one and it was saying something crazy about Melaene Trump.
