So in reading this. the layout looks I don't know if it is reliable the layout, the NPR Shots information thing looks nice, but when they used the quote 'We wrote about it and everything' it wasn't really just the way they worded things seemed like it wasn't really proofread, which leads me to believe it's not really all that reliable. It's still seems to come from a good source. I don't know, I rate it like and 8. The fact that is comes from NPR, not sure what that is, but the layout makes it look professional. The wording. It wasn't well-written, so I'm not sure that it was proofread. So I thought it was well-written, it looked like a reliable source because it was from the Huffpost, which made me think it is a reliable source. It looks, I don't know how to explain it. They had a lot of facts, a lot of interesting sources. the layout, the word usage. Um, I'll rate it a 9 or 10. Just because the layout again looks nice, also, I feel like they have a graphic/map. I didn't really read it yet, but. Continues skimming over article. Yeah, so they used really credible sources, such as NASA. The sources within the article are credible. Okay, so, the first thought, I've already heard of the Washington Post, so I know that it's credible. I would rate this a 10 as well, because I thought it was credible because how it was worded, and the sources that were used, and I've already heard of the Washington Post, so Known source, credible, sources within are sustainable and facts are compatible¬ùWhat makes it less reliable? There's not really anything that makes it less reliable. Alright, I don't know, first off, not even the title is grammatically correct, so at first glance I'm going to give it a 5. Yeah, so even in the first paragraph it doesn't have any facts. I mean, it does, it says it is likely to get worse' it doesn't say 'it will' or 'it won't.' One survey discovered' (referring to second orange hyperlink), so it doesn't have a credible source right there. Yeah, I'd give it about a 4. it's a factual topic??
