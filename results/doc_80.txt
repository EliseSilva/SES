Let's see. Shots. Health news from NPR. Public health. Over the counter birth control pills would be safe for teens researchers say. Are you serious? Heard on all things considered. What is that? Rebecca Hersher. Looks like a news article. We wrote about it an everything. What is that supposed to mean? We wrote about it and everything ok so they've talked about this before.  Where is this? Where are my sources? There are no sources.  Ok so there's a link. How do I find this? Let's seeNPR. There we go.  Contraceptives are potentially safer the younger you are. Well hopefully you're not sexually active. Ok. Over the counter access to oral contraceptives. Ok that's good. Alright. Is it peer reviewed? It says it's original. Well that's a primary source. Let's keep going. No evidence that increased access to birth control. I think that's kind of a valid concern, are you sure? Teen pregnancy rates are way down. Really? Let's look at that one . Oh Gracious. I'm not sure about morality here. Ok so the first one I thought maybe it was a 5 afterwards I probably thought it was more like a 7 because there was a primary source at the end there. Oh no. It's a news cite. So this is a secondary source. I suppose the source is ok.  What makes the source ok? They referenced several primary sources which came from qualified experts we'll say. And they were accessible from the article. It also came from a well-known news sourceWhat qualities or attributes made it less reliable? Ok so this article was a secondary source and if I was using it in a paper I would only use this source as a means to finding primary research, at which point I would only use the primary research of that source, not the rambling conglomerate of information this article shows. Let's see what else. Ok I'm going to look back at this article. So it is from NPR. I feel like another thing is it's also a news source, and a lot of news sources use sensationalism, which I felt this article leaned on. So basically there was primary research backing it up, but it was a secondary source itself. It was just compiling this together. If I hadn't had access to those I wouldn't be able to trust them because they didn't have listed sources at the end they were just linked in. What if the links hadn't been working it would have just been a highlighted blue word and so unless you go and check them you can't actually know they are reliable sources. On the other hand it looks like they were peer reviewed. I would trust the primary source but I wouldn't' think that this is a great source to use. I mean it might be a good springboard for you to find some more primary research to build your own opinion on but I wouldn't necessarily take this as everything that it is. I mean it's a good place to start but not a good place to finish for a paper. Alright onto the next one. Huffpost. Oh! Huffpost is great, but also again it's kind of a news site and can be written by a bunch of different people and it's covered in adds which is another thing. I think they get money off of advertising so that makes it a little less credible.  Yeah there's a lot of adds on here 23 foods that can trigger my brain cells. Oh that looks very sensationalized and probably true to some extent or other. You are what you eat, but. Ok and then lots of ways to share  let's see. Let's find this. So studying the screenshot I'd say it's probably a 6. The thing that decreases it is I mean looking through here it looks like they have some good research to back it up. I can't click on it or see any links but maybe I'll find that when I research. The main thing is that this is absolutely covered in ads. However the thing that makes it better is that it is written by the president and founder of the Savannah College of Art and Design. That's something that's significant. Of course she should know at least a little bit of what she's talking about in her field. I'd say that makes it a 6 or 7 and I'll probably put it on a 6 for now. Let me go to my research here. Ok more adds. Lots of very sensationalized adds on here about Duck Dynasty and Trump and all those other things people like to talk about.  Increasingly millennials and members of generation cz lassic liberal learning where students. Ok here we go. Here's a specific source of herself I helped create the Savannah College of Art and Designso I set up to change that. Here is the first mention that I have seen of the Harvard Business Review of something that seems like a legitimate outside suggestion here. And it's paraphrased. And there is a link so we'll click on that. Harvard Business Review. And here though this is once again just a review so it's not exactly primary research. It's secondary. Toggles back to HuffPost and clicks on hyperlink to Colleges are going online to crowdsource donations and they're raising millions. What's that article? So Washington post. So I'm not seeing a lot of primary research here to back it up which is rather disappointing. So that's really going to take down the score of this because they've only cited secondary sources. So I'm probably going to put this at a 4 now. I would say it's more reliable just because Yeah it's written by someone who knows what she's talking about. it's written by a person with good authority in her field. The spelling, grammar, and structure make it look more legitimate, and she poses great points and a large variety of issuesThe problem with it is that. Her citations are two more secondary sources, not primary ones. The whole page is covered in advertisements, that makes it more of a campaigning article than a very trustworthy research article.If you're just reading it for general fun, what the heck fine. But don't give it too much credence until you do a little more research let's say. The Blaze. Oh I don't like the way that looks.  Meditation the overlooked Christian discipline. I'm not even reading the article I'm reading the header. And here's all these very sensational advertisements on the right yet again like famous group sites. That's how they get their funding. Justin Haskins. April 2  Global warming fail. Study finds meltinganimals. Oh let's talk about this some more! I enjoy this. Alright. If I'm just looking at these screenshots here. Alright here we've got a chart. I like that. Charts are great. It looks like there are some links here. So once again advertisements kind of take it down but as a whole you know the site I haven't looked at it yet, but The blaze? That doesn't sound real great so I'm going to put it at a 7 just because it looks like there is some real research here  but it's covered in the site that looks kinda risky. Site's not great but looks like there's some background information here so I'm going to look this up now. Opens up tab and types global warming fail: study finds melting sea ice is actually helping arctic animals. Well arctic animals that doesn't cover all of global warming. I don't know if that means that global warming has failed butok the blaze.com. Reads under breath. Let's click on the new study and find out what we've got there  What the? What? Ok. From the university of south Denmark, ok. So this is a link to another article that's not even primary research. That's a little sad. This site. I want some primary research.  Now finally I find a link to other primary research. Why didn't the original link to this primary research that's what I want to know? However the primary research looks pretty legitimate just from a quick glance. So as far as The Blaze vs whatever site it sent me to. What's up with that. Spelled W-U-W-T. Watts up with that? That's not even funny. The site isn't even that great. The Blaze. Why link to that site and not just the pimary research? That would make it so much more legitimate on the first runaround. As I continue to read from The Blaze here we've got recent data released by scientists at NASA. Let's click on that and see what we find here. USA Today again. Not actually from NASA just another site quoting. And look at all these adds. This is kinda nice. There's lots of pictures. So that's kinda cool. Let's look down. But just again it's another news site. It's USA Today. So I'm overall not impressed. I'm going to put it at a 5 not because it didn't link to legitimate sources but because  What's this? Apparently a sketchy site thing popped up so that's not good. Oh sorry that's not reliable that's less reliable.  The research was legitimate, butThe graphs were nice, and once again these were fine for first run-around type things but I wouldn't use them in my paper. The research was legitimate and the graphs were nice, but The blaze wite itself didn't link to credible primary sources, but it redirected to more articles siting the primary research.  There were a lot of adds in the article and the links themselves, and in clicking on one, I had a new window appear on the computer that was not in anyway related to the article. Alright the screenshot. Reads under breath title of article, Elon Musk's SpaceX makes history by launching a flight proven rocket' Ok so here's a video from the Washington post probably a news video. So when I first saw it I'd probably say it's around a  6. So because this is done I'd probably put this at a 7 or an 8. Because it's been recorded by a reporter in personal contact it's pretty reliable considering we haven't seen any extra research from the individuals themselves. It's also from a well-known news source, and was less interpretive than informative.What makes it less reliable? Well-known news source, the advertisements, and it's been typed by a reporter. The very things that makes it strong are also the things that makes it not reliable because you are relying on a reporter. They could have made it up for all you know or they could just be relaying the information they got in different interviews and different things. I don't know, that one was kind of a mixed bag. It was pretty good, though. What the? Daily Kos. republicans, democrats, science, politics and ads. This looks like a political news page and I don't trust politics. So probably a 4 before I've read it. This is kind of strange. Daily Kos, yeah. Now I have all of these things it wants me to take political action. So advertisements. Advertisements and it's a political site that's bent on convincing not informingOk let's see what that link is. Here we have a PDF to a workforce report. It looks great. Are there sources on the bottom? There are some footnotes. From Wisconsin. All Wisconsin. I think they did mention that it was all from Wisconsin. Ok so that just sent me to the Washington post which is a news site. I wasn't impressed by the sources that it used. More news sites and ONE Wisconsin studyOverall I think I'd probably rate it a 5. It's not very reliable, nor or is unreliable. They did site a study. and the site is apparently open for all kinds of edits and postingWhere is the reliability of Laura Clawson? It has her location and her groups/areas she's published in but.there's no credibility of the authority of the authorNope. Down to 4. Ok It's not very reliable, nor is it unreliable.  They did site a study. Advertisements, and it's a political site that's bent on convincing, not informing.  I wasn't impressed the sources that it usedmore news sites and Wisconsin study, and the site is apparently open for all kinds of edit or posting.  There's no credibility of the authority of the author.
