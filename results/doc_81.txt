So from the screenshot picture it may look like a reliable source. It really depends what this website is if it's credible or not. So it looks like there is a radio station. Based off of the language that they use. It says Polisy-ish it doesn't interest me in reading. Treatments, public health, policy-ish. So I'm not sure if I would actually trust all of the sources here. I wish they would kind of sayLet's see who they are. So they do have quite a bit of text which could lead you to believe that they are reliable. They do mention some other sources and sponsorship. Great storytelling and rigorous reporting. So they are an established company however it seems as if their take on many things may just be on opinion. You can tell it's not an official or formal article  'we wrote about it and everything.' You can tell it's commenting on the fact that birth control would be safe it were over the counter. The fact that righty here it does mention a quote from a pediatrician from the Johns Hopkins School of medicine. That does give it support. the quotes used in this article from John Hopkins, the mentioning of California law practices. It also does help to verify talking about the FDA in California and Oregon processes. That inclines me to trust what they say about these law changes. Their choice of words does not make the article formal and on the Shots website it explains 'story telling and rigorous reporting.' Going back to the website that doesn't exactly explain what is going on. We are reporters in Washington DC in bunkers, streets, alleys, jungles and deserts around the world so it kind of does just seem like an opinion. Their choice of words does not make the article formal and on the Shots website it explains 'story telling and rigorous reporting.' I feel it's more based off opinion than facts, (policy-ish tab on website). Huff post. Just by the name of it I feel it is reliable because this is a very well-known website. Without even reading it I will be more trusting of the article and what it says. So if I come over here to Huff Post  automatically, automatically I believe it's reliable. They have much more credibility to them that the website SHOTS we just looked at. Just the tabs down here. makes it seem like they actually have some credibility. They have some videos. They have some political situations, some debates going on, top stories, I mean they're all updated. We can find who it is that are writing the posts. Obviously they have some opinion and some humor going on but the fact that it does have to do with the news defiantly is a bigger sorry I'm just reading theseit's definitely a bigger reason for me to believe they are reliable. I'm going to give them a 10 because I've studied before from this Huffington Post and I really do like the way that they present themselves. The article itself is definitely more formal than the last. They do have some statistics presented. Some more credible quotes here listed. Even these icons on the side  that they are so publicly known that you can Tweet them or share their post. That also makes them credible. This is definitely one-sided.  That's what I thought. So even right here. HuffPost politically liberal which might not be what everybody agrees with, however they do present themselves in a way that is very well-known. This is a very left wing website so their posts are very extremely opinionated. They do have quite a bit of humor or irrelevant topics for such a politically centered online newspaperUnder more reliable records. The fact that HuffPost is very popular and well known demonstrates that they do have credibility and a large fan-base and sources of sponsorship even if I do not agree with it. The organization of the website gives credibility to their company. They have done their homeworkSo whether I agree with it or not it does seem like a website or a company that has done their homework and they do know what they are talking about even if their perspectives are skewed. The blaze. Hm. Not sure if I've ever heard of The Blaze. News channels my voice radio and TV. See that gets pretty high up there get the blaze newsletter.  Let's see. Authentic. Unfiltered. Fearless. It's a digital network that provides platform. ok so it might not be as formal as the Huffington post, however they do so them being a company about voices it's probably more opinionated. Researchers at university of southern Denmark studying melt ponds in arctic waters stay that the press release researchers professor Ronni NASA graphs, charts, dates, exact statistics. They provide credible quotes, graphs, statistics, and a very straight-forward point of view. Their emphasis on presenting voices may make it seem more like opinions than anything concrete and factual. This is definitely something that I would believe. If they were telling me this with all of this background information. Washington Post. Even more believable than the HuffPost. These are just very, very credible sources.  Wikipedia let's see. Oh yeah. Newspaper has won 47 Pulitzer prizes. There's not even a question in my mind. Seems like we are getting more credible every source that we look at. Let's go here: very well-known site and source to gain information. Provides knowledge straight forward and is cleanly presented.I'm not sure if there is anything I wouldn't believe written by the Washington PostI'm not sure if there's anything that makes it less reliable for me. This source has already won that credibility. Daily Kos. Never heard of this. Just by the titles it's not as formal as something so established as Washington Post. Maybe this is a very popular source, however.  No, no, no. No Merrick Garland for FBI director, you idiots! That does not make me interested at all to read and accept the views that this article will have. Or right here, this title. Hm. Its' not something that I would believe. This is not something that I think hasthis doesn't demonstrate education and formality to me. They are definitely very passionate about what they believe. Or course. Focuses on liberal American politics. Very, very extreme.  Less Reliable: Very extreme liberal politics that are very passionate about making their points. The titles alone, including swear words and words like idiot do not show, to me, that it is a reliable source.
