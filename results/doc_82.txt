I want to know more about this policy statement so I'm going to try and look up the policy statement that came out about oral contraception without prescription. I'm getting a lot of research articles coming up including the one that was provided. I think this might be it. So I'm on the American college of obstetricians and gynecologists websites and this looks like it's the statement in December of 2012. I'll just read the abstract. Interesting so that just verifies the information that was in the article. So they did say that women should have access to over the counter contraceptives. Now I want to know more about that California and Oregon law I found a website called slate.com that I'm looking at. It's just saying that they are allowing pharmacists to distribute contraceptive including patch, ring, and the pill so more than just oral contraceptives which is what the group had said. So they're allowing for more than that. So just trying to scroll quickly through this. I couldn't quickly find anything. Yeah so they can get their prescription drugs from the pharmacist. So everything is just affirming what was given from this website. What website is this? NPR? So I just looked up the reliability of NPR as aw website and this website popped up talking about the credibility of it and chooses first option from webpubthursday.wordpress.com which is an analysis of NPR.org. It's a complete website. It's updated often. It doesn't have an author. It's professional. So this website webpubthursday say that they have a 9.5 for NPR. So I would trust this source. I have heard of it. I don't know a lot about it, but yeah. Oh I had forgotten to rate the reliability before. I would have given it an 8 before my additional research because it looks professional, it is citing multiple sources. After browsing I would up it to a 9 if I could give it I wouldn't give it a 10 just because I don't know. I have issues trusting something completely. To answer the question what qualities or attributes make this source more reliable, I'm just going to write it in a list and not in complete sentences: Referencing a Johns Hopkins professor. Outside information about states that have laws in place. Links to works cited. One of the things that really helped me was referencing a Johns Hopkins professor because that is an accredited institution. Also outside information about states have laws in place. Also I didn't go to the actual website of this article but the fact that you can go to links that you can follow that will lead you to the works that they are citing: links to works cited. Normally when people cite their works it means that they are more reliable. Using humor in a professional source. One of the only things that kind of bothers me about it and makes it a little less reliable is the 2nd paragraph and 2nd sentence which says 'we wrote about it and everything' so just like using humor in a professional source. This is a serious topic and I don't think that using humor was the appropriate thing. So there you go. moving on. How many of these do I have to do? Doesn't say!  So right away she presented an argument Paula presented an argument and I feel like she hasn't really touched on both sides of the argument and she's just presented her own and she is convinced that she's right because it's her's. I don't know her so I don't know if I can trust her. But maybe with research she'll be reliable. I'm hesitant to give it a super high rating because I don't know who she is and I've never heard of this school she's a president of and I feel like this is just her opinion and it's not really factual so I'm giving it a 6. So to start up I'm going to look up her, Paula Wallace, and see what I can find out about her and see how reliable she is. I'll go to Wikipedia, because I like Wikipedia. Georgia State is where she went to school. She's written many books. She's very acclaimed in Georgia. She makes a lot money. I don't know if that's a bad things, but she make 9.6 million dollars a year which is the highest paid college leader so I'm just kinda wondering if what she is talking about is maybe about is because she's made her money and she wants to make more money. I'm kind of weary in that. I like what she's saying I think it's good information but. What website was this published on? Huffington Post?  I mean I've heard of them so. What I'm seeing things that says it might not be as reputable as it says it is. So the posts aren't always written by writers. Anyone can write on there. So they can't be fact-checked. I still don't trust this source so I'm going to bring it down to 5. What qualities made it more reliable? I think things that made it more reliable were: writing style was professional. it was well organized, good word choice. I'm going to skip down to the second question, what qualities/attributes make this source less reliable?: Author's lifestyle. Salary.I don't know how to say it but the fact that the author's lifestyle. Salary.Basically salary is what threw me up because if someone's being paid that much, they are very much about themselves. And I could be wrong, but I don't really have a lot more thoughts on that, I'm moving on. Global warming, wow. This is a hot topic. Global warming fail, melting sea ice is actually helping arctic animals. So I took a biology class and we talked about this. We said that it's not, but I'll read and then talk about the credibility. Credibility. This is going to sound weird, but the fact that there are so many ads is throwing me off. It doesn't look very professional. I have never heard of this website. The sources they are citing I am sure there is a university of southern Denmark, but I've never heard about it. Even when they did cite NASA it was just statistics so it didn't really help to prove their point. I don't think this is very reliable so I'm going to give it a 5. I'm going to start by looking up The Blaze and their credibility. So right away it says that it is right biased. This might be talking about political affiliation I believe. It says they try to use wording to try to influence an audience which isn't necessarily bad. I guess it would be. It's saying they are a biased source. And then I want to know more about the author, Justin HaskinsWell he tweets a lot. That's something that popped up quickly. He works for the heartland institute. There is contact information for him so that's slightly more reliable. He's been published in a wide variety of magazines. So he's a reliable source but they were talking about his republican bias. An then I want to know more about the university of southern Denmark. They've got 26,000 students. They aren't a very old university but that doesn't necessarily mean bad. Oh, it's from a merge. They have lots of facilities. I like that they have a fiscal address I feel like that's more reliable. I think I'm going to leave it where it's at. sources NASA and University of Southern Denmark. Graph. I just like pictures. I feel like they are an easier way to see data. Finding out bias of the website and author. And that's what I've got for that one. Moving on. Elon Musk. I can't even say his name. That's probably bad. So right away this is the Washington post. I know that they are pretty well known. And I know that Elon Musk the Tesla guy is well known and very rich and very successful. I'm going to go ahead and read the article This is talking about Space X and the fact that they have been able to reuse rockets. I have heard about this in the news so this is something I'm familiar with. I know that they did reuse the rocket. So that's a fact. Musk called it a milestone. I am going to go ahead and put it in source more reliable as familiarity with the topic Just the fact that I've heard people talk about it. I know that what they are staying is true at a base level. The only thing I could really debate is I feel like their plan to make Mars just not a one way mission but I will go ahead and put reliability at like a 9 because I know it happened, but I'm going to look up the Washington post and their credibility Oh no. So I actually didn't know this. It's for DC I actually thought it was in the state. It's a reliable source. Well I don't want to say it's a reliable source but it's a well-known source. And it has history on its side. And then who wrote this, Christian Davenport. So he's an author. That's interesting. He Tweets, he is into political stuff which is a little weird because this isn't political to me. So it's a little weird that a political writer would be writing about space. I'm looking up Space X Now Private company. 15 years old. They've got a really long list of achievements. From here I'm going to go to Elon Musk's page  He's space X he's Tesla, he's 45. Does it have his net worth? Yeah 50.2 billion. I really don't see anything that makes this unreliable. I am just going to say quotes from Musk used as facts when they are opinions but I think it is very reliable. I am going to leave it at 9. Familiarity with topic Quotes from Musk used as facts when they are opinions. Moves to final article from Daily KosDaily Kos. Interesting. I've never really heard of that website. Not sure how reliable that is. There's a growing crisis in care for disabled and elderly people. Oh, and it's a jobs crisis, too. I like more condensed titles. It's cluttered. But we'll see how the article goesI don't love this source because I feel like it has an agenda, not just presenting facts But what I do like. I do like that it is the personal stories, relations to the topic, links to sources. Let me learn more about this website, Daily Kos credibility. Here we go It's extreme left. It says it has mixed factual reporting. This website is saying that you should fact check it every time.  there is another thing that says it is a mouthpiece for a broken system. People are saying that it is entertaining and very persuasive. Who is our author? Laura Clawson. Ok I can't really find any information on her other than just what she's written. It looks like a lot of articles. So at the beginning I would have rated this as a 6 and now I'm going to rate it at a 4. personal stories, relations to the topic, links to sources has an agenda, not just presenting facts moves to last page of questions.
