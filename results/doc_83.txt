NPR, I've heard of them. 'Over-The-Counter Birth Control Pills Would Be Safe For Teens, Researchers Say.'  Would be safeReads a few passages under his breath. Okay wait what is this. It says 'Krishna Upadhya, an assistant professor of pediatrics' okay that's one quote thoughand then who's this written by.  Rebecca Hersher.  Let's see who that is.  Opens a new tab and types in Rebecca hersher What the incognito what is this supposed to mean?  Okay never mind I guess I won't worry about that. Hersherwho are you?  NPR okay, let's look up a little about her.  What is all this junk. I need to know about you specifically, friend. Ahhh, March, 2016, or March 16th, 2017 I mean. Oh! And it's .org.  Npr.org.  That sounds reliable. Yeah. Especially since NPR, they're kind of, I'm pretty sure they're politically unbiased. Let me see. A liberal bias.  Really NPR's liberal, but not very.  Okay so a little bit liberal no, yeah they're reliable.  I wish I new who this person was.  Goes back to Rebecca hersher tab.  Canges is to Rebecca hersher npr Who are you?  I want to figure it out but not spend too much time.  A journalist it appears she's a journalist.  She has good sources though.  High reliability.  Yeah that's high. Okay I kind of already did that. I'm gonna say it's 10 again. Okay I've already kind of used up a nice amount of time: This source is a website, that I have heard of before and I have found credible.  It is also a dot org website which means they aren't necessarily only focused on money, but are an organization.  The article had good sources form the quotes it had, sourcing form Universities, and Schools of Medicine. The only thing is that I couldn't find much information on the person writing the article itself. HuffPost let's look it up first. Oh! So this isI've actually used this this is huffington Post.com.  Okay I'm just reading down, trying to look for any quotes or any sourcing to outside sources or references.  I see Harvard Business review, but that's not much.  Michael D. King.  Who is heit does not say.  Seems like this could heavily be like calling an opinion sort of thing  So this guyyeah I mean hmmm let me look up this person.  It's written by Paula Wallace. I'll look that up. Clicks first result, her Huffpost bio.  Alright, nice a little bio!  I like it.  'President and Founder of Savanah College of Art and Design.'  So a college of art and designwriting onwell what is the article really saying, that's what I've got to figure out.  Can't reallykind of read the little comment under the photo but I kind of agree with that but then againthis is like there it says 'it should'so it's not really a fact it's kind of like a, it's definitely an opinion.  Definitely. Okay she's the founder of a college of art and design.  I mean that's kind of related to universities, but not really what they're teaching, she's more inthat department.  'is the presidentof a private, nonprofit accredited university with 100-plus academic degree programs and five locations'okay.  Pretty cool I guess wait wait wait is president oh so this is an actual university, okay.  That makes more sense.  'In 2015 SCAD was ranked among the top five universities in the Americas and Europe by Red Dot.' Really that's kind of I'd like to see where that came from.  'Wallace has also been appointed'  I do not know what that means.  Okay so that all seems like she knows what she's talking about, she's been president of some universities. Alright now let's see, I'm just going to look up really quick, Huffington Post credibility. Hmmm. First hit from Wikipedia, a very debatable reliable source. '3 depectively reputable sources that aren't what they seem to be'oh dear. Quora, I know Quora it's like just totally opinion.  Um I don't even know why I'm really reading thisyeah okay that just kind of reinforces what I was thinking about it. It's just kind of like an opinion editorial.  I mean it looks kind of more like a news thing, Huffington Post.  So how reliable is this?  Kind of like just Huffington Postit's fairly reliable I'd give it an eight. Alright let's finish this up quickly. 'Please take two more minutes using the browser' yes I did that. What this reliable was that the author of the article was credible and reliable in that she is a president of about five universities and she probably knows a bit about university education. It's from Huffington Post which is heavily viewed so it should at least be a little reliable. I mean it's split up into five universities but she's president of one of them. And that's because a lot of people are going to see it and if it's something totally unreliable people will catch it for sure and call them out on it. It's huffington post.  And it's not really a primary research website, they tend to give personal views or opinions on news or on new things or news that just came out, or popular subjects.What's that word I'm looking for?  Primary? Primary research? Secondary research? Let me see if that's the word I'm looking for. New research yeah Ooooh the Blaze, this already does not look credible. You know why? It just looks unprofessional.  Just 'The Blaze.'  Just that name, first of all.  I don't know why, but I get a vibe.  What's coming into my mind now is The Onion. I don't know why that's coming into my mind but it is.  They have a big nice ad right there.  Tons of ads, which is also saying.  'Why do the Amish keep these secrets?' So they have a lot of ads which means they're trying to get a lot of money.  Let's just look at there website really quick and see what type of website they are. Alright, is it theblaze.com?  It is theblaze.com.  Oh! There is so many ads on here!  So many ads.  Let me see if I click on this one what it will do. 'Pop-up blocked.  This is like, a terrible website.  I'm just putting that out there right now.  I clicked on that link and it said pop-up blocked. 'Oh do you want to leave this site? Changes may not be saved'  oh my gosh.  Ohhhh that's just too good, this is just a bad site, I'm sorry. 'Poll reveals how Americans really feel about Trump firing Comey.' Oh yeah, how Americans really feel.  Must have been a huge poll yeah?  All Americans or something have been polled by it?  Okay this just looks really dumb.  Okay this one is notthis one is sponsored by Stansberry. 'there's a PSA circulating advising how to hide child porn: is it real or a hoax?  OkayBy Glenn Beck.  Let's click on it. Why? Where is that coming from? I'm not listening to that.  Sorry.  Okay, wrong article, I'm supposed to be studying this one.  Okay Justin haskins.  That's who I'm looking up.  Goes back to tab and googles Justin haskins the blaze. Okay let's look upis there anything on himoh look there's a little profile on him. Let's seezero followers.  I'm sure if this person was better they'd have a lot more, and this is on theblaze.com he's only been around since 2015, he's been around for about two years, likes to talk a lot about elections, Ted Cruz, a lot of political stuff. The Blaze, I already don't like this website, they have a ton of ads.  Okay let's read this a little bit. 'long claimed wildlife are harmed signficiantly'  and where's your backup?  Where's your structure to that? 'that unless mankind stops producing' okay here's an ultimatum.  'unless mankind stops producing significant amounts of carbon-dioxide emissions, the world's animals will not be able to thrive' Okay'At the university of southern Denmark'okay'suggests animals in the Arctic region are thriving as because are thriving as because'are thriving because of okay so there's already a typo in here.  This is like their credibility is already going down. I don't care if they referenced a university, anyone can do that. You can probably find something ancient that was like, bad from a university but it doesn't even say who, it just says 'University of Southern Denmark.' Okay, what are you reallywhat is this guy trying to prove?  He just said the warming was harming, and now he's saying it's like helping? And it says according to a press release. It doesn't even sayno this is likeI almost don't even want to read the rest of this. Keeps reading.  'This is the conclusion of researchers in the periodical, Polar Biology.'  WHAT?  Okay, so, that is notI don't like it. Okay, now we're getting an actual quote from Prof. Ronnie Glud. Okay it might be credible, I'm gonna give it a 5 though.  It has a lot of outside sourcing to other references including Universities, Nasa, and other study's. First off, it looks unprofessional and there are a ton of ads on the page. When I clicked on a link on their website, it gave me a warning message when I tried to leave it. It was a commercial website rather than an organization or govenernment website.That's about all it has going for it yeah?  Do I agree with that?  So they have this little chart herewell if you have quotes that like I said before, if you have quotes that kind of support, well you can make up an opinion on something totally, totally made up, could be completely wrong, you're able to find quotes every once in a while, around.  SoI don't really like this one.  Global warming failyeah seems a little bit like pop, culture a little bit.  First off, it looks unprofessional Like I might be wrong, they could be totally professional but they just don't appear that way so they need to change that either way. and there are a ton of ads on the page. So that means they're trying to get money somehow.  Like I don't remember butlet's go to NPR  They might have some ads.  This is thereokayso NPR links to our sponsors.  These are people who have paid NPR to be on here.  Not vice versa where they're payingwell actually no that's how all ads work my bad hahabut there's one ad on here.  One.  And it's just on the sidebar.  And it says thanks to our sponsors.  And it's by AT&T which is an original series.  I go back to the Blaze  and this thing is likehas so manyerlet's seead right theread right herethey have a lot of ads and some of these links are just really weird.  Okay. When I clicked on a link on their website it gave me a warning message when I tried to leave it. Which is very sketchy.  When that happens something's fishy.  It was a commercial website rather than an organization or government website. Hence .com.  Okay good.  This one?  I'd give it like a 6.  Because it had a lot of quotes and stuff, I mean it was really good, but some of it's just like really wrong.  No it's a 5, same as the overall. Washington PostWashington Post I already know they are a very nice they are very popular they have a lot of publicity they're very professional they have an ad right there, ad right there.  Only two ads which is not bad actually at all.'Elon Musk's SpaceX makes history by launching a flight-proven rocket.'  So this is kind of just likejust kind of reporting on something that actually happened.  Christian Davenport What the Interesting.  Bezos owns the Washington Post.'  Ooooo okay, so that's definitely something to be aware of.  Washington Post guy with an article on Washington Post.  Okay. an at times rabid fan base that treats the launches like groupies do rock concerts.'  I mean they're exciting, this guy seems a little bit cranky already. Sound begins playing from an unknown location.  Where is that a pop-up I see? ! Oh my gosh something that was from the Blaze, guaranteed. Okay so first off I know this is Washington Post so I know it's pretty credible.  The guy's not putting very much you know arguable things in the text he's just kind of like reporting what happened, so that makes it really credible. Ummm does anything make it uncredible? There's a lot of ads I guessI mean I guess they have to make money somehow but Just based off this yeah it seems like a 10. I mean there's nothing really fishy about it. Okay now let's look up Washington Post dot com it's a commercial website.  'Democracy Dies in Darkness'  Is this Republican? Liberal  Here's a website; 'Why the Washington Post Has No Credibility' by Matt Barber from Townhall. I don't even know what Townhall is, why should we trust you? Yeah and who are you to saythere are a TON of ads on this one.  Okay who are you and why is that so. Is founder and editor-in-chief of BarbWire.com.  Oh yeah  That's veryvery'and an attorney concentrating in constitutional law.  Having retired as an undefeated heavy weight professional boxer, Matt has taken his fight from the ring to the culture war.' Okay.  Nope.  I'm not believing that.  Dot comit's a little bit biased.  It's a littledemocratic? Okay.  Ummm probably give it an eight.  Lower side of an eight.  It's a popular website, Washington Post.  It presents a lot of facts and is more featured as a news article rather than an opinion/lifestyle article.  It also has a lot of direct quotes. Boom. Okay and why is it not? It is a commercial website, which is never as reliable as an education, government, or organization website.  It also has a lot of ads and appears to have a political bias on some of it's posts.  The author also has no professional knowledge on his subject. Boom. Okay Daily KosI kind of like it already, just because the uh the outlineI mean the presentation of the website looks really nice.  I like how it says Republicans and Democrats at the first  it kind of proves that it's not very biased in either way.  Okay it says 'There's a growing crisis in care for disabled and elderly people.  Oh, and it's a jobs crisis, too.'  That's kind of interesting.  I dunno.  I just kind of like this website and article already, I haven't really read much of the article: Oh that's really bad. Gives a link to that survey so that's good.  It's better than the other one where it just said 'a survey.'  Oh cool.  Okay, that's some good  So I kind of like this, right now.  I would saythis is an 8 on reliability. Nooooo let's find out.  Okay, Daily Kos Oh, even on Google, this thing looks good.  Sees a link to their twitter page, opens it in a new tab.  Let me just quickly see how many followers it hason Instagram  Not too many actually.  258,000.  Interesting okay now let's go to the website, dot com.  Okay I clicked on it and there's automatically this thing that popped up.  It says send a letter to yourokay it's kind of like a plea for something. Okay ummm  Okay.  There's like two ads, not too much.  Big ad across the top.  Let's look up who's the writer, Laura clawson. Let's find out about this person. Hm. Since 2006, nice!  Labor editor since 2011.  Trusted userwait WHAT?  Okay she's part of the staff.  I was about to think She's from DCTwitter This might be weird I'm pulling up her Twitter.  Huh!  She's a labor editor Daily Kos.  Okay that's her job the daily Kos. Okay, diaries published 8,329, nice.  Okay it doesn't say anything about her past education which is kind of sketchy. This is her profile yeah.  Keeps looking for more information.  It does not say.  Like, she's been around doing this for a while.  But which I mean 2011, she's been doing that for about six years.  Which is about longer than some undergraduate no.  That's longer than some people go to college for.  Okay let's go back.  She doesn't havebut when she started though yeah how would you rate this article's reliability. I'll give it a 7. Why? UmmmThe amount of quotes and references were really good in making it reliable.  Looks professional and has good statistics in the article. it was a .com website, the author has little to no formal training, not a popular company/website.
