We wrote about it and everything' seems kind ofcolloquial.  That's the word. Okay 'There is no scientific rationale for limiting access not seeing a source for that. Journal of Adolescent Health, let's seepublished in a medical journal, looks like. Okay it says NPR, but I don't recognize that logo um don't knowI mean it does seem like they know what they're talking about, but, seeing this colloquial line here 'we wrote about it and everything.'  Don't see any sources until the very end of the screenshotand I don't know just the way this is formatted at the top. Probably give it like a sixwe'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go 6. Alright let's take a look. Oh, there it is.  Let me see here.  Scans it.  Okay, where did they get this particular statistic? well depending on who you are that's either good or bad.  Anyway. I don't know  Still seems kind of sketchy, I don't see any sited sources, I did see .org so that kind of gives them the benefit of the doubt, I'm probably going to keep my rating the same. The fact that it was a .org' website gave it some credibility.  While they didn't provide many sources, there were still some provided statistics to back up the argument. The format of the logo made me question whether or not this was the real NPR.  Also, the lack of cited sources was not very comforting, as I couldn't trust whether or not the provided data was legitimate.  K, huffpost.  Maybe I'm just really behind on logos and websites, cause this still doesn't look very legit.  Let's see.  President and founder of Savahnah College of Art and Design. Okay well I know it's a real university. True. Hmmm. Vocabulary much? Okay I'm seeing some pretty valid points here.  I guess, you know, it seems like she knows what she's talking about, doesn't she right? C.  Yeah. 'Not long ago in the Harvard Business review'okay.  So there is another source to back it up. Maybe it's because I'm always just a suspicious person I'm feeling really skeptical about these.  This one does feel more reliable than the last one. Let's check it out. Huffingtonpost.com .com's not very credible. What is that a URL? Yeah.  Right. It's funny they have usso much effort into citing our sources on papers but so many online articles arenothing like it. K I'm guessing she's just summarizing the point here?  Okay. Might take it down a notch. The author had some of their credentials posted which made the website seem more believable. The fact that it is a .com website put me off, and there was also the fact that she had only one source.Okay, next. Okay the Blaze.  Glenn Beck used to be on the Blaze so it's pretty conservative I think.  Yeah.  'Researchers at the University of Soutern Denmark' okay  suggests animals in the Arctic region are thriving as because of higher global temperatures okay the grammar their seems a little off.  The press release.  Okay who's talking at this press release? I'd like to know  Ooo they threw in a chart.  Fancy.  'Source: Nasa's Grace satellites.' Okay! Let's take a look at the rest of this. So yeah I know from experience thatyou know Blaze isI guess you could say it's kind of like an independent.  They do more like TV radio entertainment deals.  My dad and I used to listen to Glenn Beck all the time, only reason I know about it.  Ummmmso you have an author.  I guess the fact that it is kind of an independent, you know, non-academic website explains all the side ads.  Then again that's kind of hard to avoid in modern day society.Alright so here we have the graph again. 'land ice loss' okay'usa today' alright 'recently declared the loss of sea ice suggests these claims are overblow when put into perspective. Anthony watts on his influential climate-change website' what's that?...'the president of the Royal Society in London'so this paragraph I assume you already know who Anthony Watts is sort of'the president of the royal society in London reported in 1817 significant reductions to arctic sea ice okay is that a year because that was a long time ago, I don't know how that's relevant. Okay so he finishes up with the quotes.  I'm guessing this is like a link to the guy's page. So I guess it kind of counts as a source.  Okay.  Well let me think here.  Goes back to survey.  First glance, I'd give it a six. Scrolls down to the post-questions.  Well, kind of going with what I knowthis really isn't designed to provide facts, this website is based a lot on opinions.  For me that kind of changes the credibility a little bit.  So I can't defy the fact that they did do their researchor at least they make it look like they did.  So I'll probably keep it at like a 6. They provided sources and stats to back up their points.Less Reliable: My previous knowledge of the website made me question how biased this article is. Alright, wellcredible source, sort of I guess. Okay. Looks like we have a video. Lot's of side ads again. Looks like these are probably links to other articles.  Okay.  Let me see.  I'm seeing a couple quotes in here.  Space X's president, okay.  'The technology has also been pursued by Jeffrey P. Bezo's Blue Origin space company Bezos owns the Washington Post'  okayside note I guess.  The launch at 6:27 PM marked the first time that a rocket had flown a payload to orbit, landed vertically and then been reused.' Oh I guess that's what theI guess that's what all the hububs about.  Something they can reuse.  Okay.  I don't know.  I know from American Heritage Washington Post is also pretty biased. Let's take a look. There's the video again Okay so there's another person.  Alan Stern, a former Nasa executive okay well if you put the credentials in it makes it a little more believable. yeah, yeah Let's see who it's written by Christian Davenport, and what do we have down here? Okay wellI guess that makes it a little more believable but then we have a twitter thing okay whatever. I'll bump it up to a five. They provided background on the author and other people cited in the article to provide credibility. The author provided his Twitter contact info which to me is a pretty colloquial move that makes him seem less credible. Daily K-O-S okay I think those are hashtags?  okayreads title aloud interesting title.  We get more side-ads.  Looks like a lot of them are a little more related than the last one.  Okay.  Well at first glance, things seem to be in order.  'one survey discovered.'  One survey.  Okay.  'president and chief executive of Leading Age Wisconsic, which represents not-for-profit long-term care institutions' okay again, background on the quote.  Credibility.  That's good.  '28 years in the business' again establishing more credibility, he knows what he's talking about.  At least we're led to think that he does. Um seems pretty good to me. I mean not perfect but I'll go ahead and give it an 8.  Now we'll check it out. Okay I was right those are( yeah I'm gonna skip that.  Okay.  'reblogged by' more of their page stags okay.  Guess it's the easiest way to get it across social media these days.  Ummm let's guess that's pretty much all there was to it. Okay. Barbara Vedder, paralyzed from the chest down, told the Washington Post's Judith Graham'okay and here's a quote okay. I don't know it still seems well with the exception of all the hashtagsand the .com is a little off-putting, and the hashtag, but I think I might put it back down to a 7. The quotes were formatted properly and the sources were given credibility. There were a lot of hashtags and the fact that it was a .com website was a little off-putting. Okay cool.
