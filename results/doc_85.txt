Okay so it's NPR, that's National Public Radio, that's important.  But it's, a little bit more liberal, so if you're seeing this this is probably a liberal source.  I see it was a kind of a radio station? 90.1? Yeah. National Public Radio.  Okay.This was 'Over-the-counter Birth Control Pills Would be safe for teens, researchers say.  Okay. I've heard All Things Considered!  I really like it.  I think they do a good job usually, but let's see.  That's my personal bias.  'Nearly five years ago, the nation's leading group of obstetricians and gynecologists' okay but which ones?...'issued a policy statement saying the time had come for oral contraception to be available without a prescription.' Okay.  'We wrote about it and everything.' 'A review of oral contraceptive research presents the most comprehensive evidence yet' so it's a review of research. That's semi-credilbe.I don't know how to describe thatIt's a well-described database I remember this word but I don't.  Ummm one study is not ait's like a research group? One study is not a large enough sample group. So I think it's interesting but it's news as well.  Also this is a news article, not a scientific journal.  It's also not peer reviewed as far as I can see It's possible, but I don't want to take too long in this.  It says only tow minutes.  Yeah, so it just says take two minutes.  If I only had two minutes to do it, I would do it just like this, I wouldn't really check for peer review on the internet, just cause it's a two minute thing.  If I were writing a research paper I'd probably evaluate longer into it to see if I could use it kind of as an emotional throw to be credited alongside other sources.  Okay.  Oh sorry I need to put it's reliability. So 10 is really relieable.  1 is not reliable at all.  SoI mean this is an interesting article obviously it's not like buzzfeed and it's notI think it's called the daily onion or something like that?  It is NPR, so it's not garbage, but I wouldn't really use it as a great source.  I'd put it about the middle, maybe a 5, because it would be interesting, but maybe not really to be usedI'm gonna put it about a 4 or a 5, we'll just do a five, that's about right where I want it. And umI'll go ahead and. My bad! I apologize. I didn't read directions well enough.  I have ADD.  I actually do that's not me joking okay, soover the counter Let's see if that's the one that I want.  So here it is!  So let's see first of all who's Rebecca herscher. She's clearly not an expert in really anything cause she just talks about everything!  But let's see if I can find out anything more about Rebecca Herscher. Who is Rebecca Hersherso she received an international reward for newsinteresting good for her.  Let's see about some of these okay so it leads me to another articleokay there's a legislative bill that it refers me to but it doesn't have anything to doon this article it just refers me to legislative bills. I want to see about this research, that's really what I'm interested in.  Because as great as government is, it's not usually as reliable as science.  Okay. Journal of Adolescent Health.  This is a peer-reviewed journal.  This is actually what I want.  So this is important.  So actually this source kind of goes up a little bit in what I'm seeing it as when I see THIS attached to it because THIS (the peer-reviewed journal) this is really important because you see MD, MD, MD, an MBA! That's also wonderful.  Great for them.  I don't know what a MPH is but I'm guessing it's important.  But I see lots of doctors there.  Those are people with degrees.  This isn't just a journalist anymore.  Even though a journalism degree is wonderful! But, this is aboust scientists.  Okay. So I'd actually start rating this source as more reliable, having seen this page. So I'm now going to delete that, and start this over. It cites a study published in a peer-reviewed journal. What else made it really reliable?  So that's really the things that I would most look for is it's kind of by NPR and it actually cites a peer reviewed journal, which is really important.  Things that make it less reliable it's actually a bit vague. It's a bit vague and doesn't establish the ethos of the study. Okay let's keep going. Ah man I forgot to do that again sorry. Okay, so I'd actually say that it's a little bit more reliable now that it's a peer reviewed journal, again though, it is an opinion piece.  Just that by itself is a 5, but when you add that other thing it makes it so much more credible.  However it is a very opinionated process, so I don't always like to hop into those. Okay so there's an ad choice at the top.  Wonderful.  Those things on the sides, these little ads, make it seem less reliable.  And as wonderful as facebook twitter pinterest and email are, this on the sides and at the top  often isn't exactly what you want.  However, some sites do use that just to pay for their site so that's kind of important to see.  This is the president and founder of Savahana college of art and design.  So this is a president of the university, well a college not a university excuse me.  I don't know what scad is. I'll be looking that up in just a second, I'm going to write that down so I don't forget it. Okay. Important to recognize. They are pulling out very specific very famous people to support one side. 'I am privileged to serve as president of a university that champions a third way' Wonderful.  Good for you. Okay. Just purely evaluating thatI don't know huff post, I don't know that they she's the president of a university but this isn't like an ivy league school. I've never heard of this school, it seems like just a vocational school.  Like charter college.  That doesn't seem very reliable. So I'm not going to be putting it up here. I'd actually move this way lower on the spectrum, I'd put it maybe between a 3 and a 4 .  And yes, they're presenting wonderful ideas, but I justI'm not really for it. Haha '4'. Okay, what is scad? Oh it's a really expensive schoolwonderful. Let's see just some basic info really quick. So SCAD, 2017 rankings unranked in Art Schools.  Okay so SCAD not that super credible. Wodnerful, SCAD has a fun new webpage.  Okay, sorry guys your school seems even less credible when I check it out. That's kind of funny.  Well I'm glad you guys are all having fun with liberal arts degrees. I am even less likely to rate you as good.  You're not very credible.  Or reliable. The author is the President of a University. That's about it.  I mean the thing that also you can maybe see.  It doesn't make it reliable, but it makes it understandableI'm not going to put it in reliable, so I'm just saying it really.  It's also understandable is they talk about the law program but that doesn't make it reliable. SCAD is unranked in arts schools as of 2017.  Also the ads on the side lead one to believe that his isn't a very reliable website, having to accept ads to pay to be on Google or another browser.  I have never heard of Huffpost.  Also the options to post it so quickly on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites makes it seem more of an opinion and less of fact.All of these ads on the side always make me think it's less real.  I don't know the Blaze.  'Global Warming Fail. Study finds melting sea ice is actually helping Artctic animals.'  Interesting.  In what way will melting the ice save the animals? Also I just did a paper on Global Warming in my WTG 150 class for an argumentative paper, so I don't really see this as a great thing.  It was renewable energy, it's just this isn't wonderful.25:45Keeps reading silently, occasionally muttering to himself.  Okay, researchers in the PERIODICAL polar biology said this.  I don't know what the periodical polar biology is, but I'm gonna have to remember that.  So I'm writing it down, not researching it yet.  I also don't know what SDU is. I have no idea where that is, so I'm also going to have that as an option. Okay, so they cite NASA, but just to say that the snow is like, melting, the ice is melting.  So that doesn't mean NASA's for what they have to say, it just means that they cited them.  And then they have a wonderful chart, good for them!  Looks at chart.  Okay, so they're telling me, of 16 million sq kilometers of ice, 2 million of that is gone since forty years ago.  That's not good.  This person doesn't seem to understand that rising water levels is not a good thing for us.  Okay, credibility of this source: not reliable.  Right now I'm leaving them at like a 1 or 2.  And I'm personally more opinionated toward like a 2, but really a 1. I don't really like what they have to say, to be totally honest.  They have too many adds on the sides, there's' Trump stuff on the sides.  Yeah this is not wonderful. Okay, two more minutes.  Let's see what SDU is. What is SDU, where is that.  I don't even know what SDU is, I looked it up but I can't find it. SD university, let's see if I can find it with that. University of South Dakota?  Okay, so someone at the University of SD said, just that there was more precipitation.  He's just saying that there could be more plant life there, that could be good.  Wonderful for them!  But he didn't make a study he didn'toh man.  'is a monthly peer reviewed' journal covering the biology of the polar regions.  Okay.  So I was fooled. I was fooled at first! This is actually a lot more reliable than you might think.  So, it's reliability;  it cites a monthly peer-reviewed journal.  It cites ummmwas he just a professor or like a department head?  No he's just  a college professor.  It has the graph. Those are all really wonderful things.  It also cites NASA. It cites a monthly peer-reviewed journal. It cites a college professor. It has the graph. It also cites NASA.Okay.  Things that make it less credible.  It's against 'popular' opinion. I was totally fooled.  I was a fool.  The ads on the sides make it seem less credible. Oh I forgot to look up also The blaze.  I don't' know what the blaze is. What is the blaze?  So it's a conservative multi-platform news so it has to do with news, which is important to recognize.  I didn't know much about the sources cited.It's against 'popular opinion. The ads on the sides make it seem less credible. I didn't know much about the sources cited. The Washington Post.  Okay, interesting.  Okay this is a newspaper, so it's an opinion article so I have to think of that right now.  This is an opinion.  Probably.  I don't know any of thatby Christian Davenport.  Okay. Good hook.  That first paraprah was a good hook it really draws the reader's attention. So lending a rocket?  Interesting.  I don't know what a Falcon 9 rocket is, and I don't know where the Kennedy space center is, but it sounds credible.  But this is Dec 2015, so we have to remember this is 2 years ago. They want to lower the cost of space-flight, interesting.  Keeps going.  Jeffery p. Bezos, Blue origin Space Company?  I don't know who that is. I don't even know what SpaceX is it seems really interesting at firstI'm not gonna lie.  But it didn't cite any sources, it just talks about a cool event.  Rates it at 6.  So I would be like wonderful!  This is great!  This is a good way to, without a whole lot of research, I could just grab this and throw it in and say yeah there it is! So it's actually somewhat credible, but I'm not going to put it above a 6 because it's not peer reviewed or anything that I can see, it's from a newspaper.  So let's go ahead and look into it now. Okay.  Jeffery P. Bezos. THAT'S WHY I  KNOW HIM! This is amazon.com!  I worked at amazon.com by the way, sorry.  So amazon.com's guy what did he say about this?  Amazon has a space company?  I had no idea?  The amazon guy owns the Washington post?  Wow!  I had no idea!  What is SpacebX? .  Cool.  Amazon's president made a space company.  Good for him! I stillI don't know I mean great?  This is just a news article, I wouldn't use it for a research paper.  I'm gonna keep it maybe at like a 7.  I didn't really raise it whole lot more.  But I put the other one at an 8  I should have put it higher.  I'm sorry, I should have put it higher I would use thisnot as like aI should have put that other one as like a nine I wish I could go back, but I don't think you can go back.  It's from a well-known newspaper. It was just interesting, to be totally honest.  But I don't know if I want to write that.  What was it that made it seem credible?  It isn't directed to state statistics but rather present concepts.More reliable: It's from a well-known newspaper. It isn't directed to state statistics but rather present concepts.And, ads on the sidesad at the topweird ad at the top. Ads always make me feel that it's less credible.  Also being from a newspaper, it could be an opinion piece rather than factual data being presented.Okay, DailyKos, don't know what it is, doesn't seem very credible from everything that I see right now. Okay, I'm going to have to see about that discovery.  Which means I now have to look up this whole article.  What qualifies as qualified?  Okay, normally I would go through looking these things up.  I would normally, me, be clicking on things.  I need to look up john sauer, and I would also be clicking on, I would be looking up there's a growing crisis in care for disabled and elderly people daily kos. Okay so first of all it says, they aren't paid enough, then it says it's medicaid's fault.  Interesting. 'Republicans are standing in the way of adequate funding'  okay so it's a political article. Okay, you see all this stuff on the side, it's like, 'I can't believe republicans are like this' it's very anti-republican on articles.  And those usually appear when your search history is like that.  Google is presenting these things to this person because they're really anti-republican.  So when that's the thing that gets presented to you let's see who everyone is. Who's John Sauer. What is thislet's see Okay this doesn't seem super credible. It just seems like someone who just wants to hit  Skip.  Okay so this page is extremely anti-republican, so really important to recognize. Really anti-republican.  Who's Laura Clawson. A trusted user, wonderful.  Okay so this isn't really someone who's wonderful at like a lot of stuff, as far as I can tell. One survey, not study, survey. So who paid for the study? Oh leading age wisconsin paid for it? Interesting.  It's a giant WI survey.  And it just says the same stuffthis doesn't really look super credible, it looks extremely opinionated.  I mean it's just not Did I rate it the first time?  My bad I'm sorry.  Okay how would I have reated it before.  I really didn't think it was that credible before. And now I think it's even less credible.  Let's put this right in the not very credible category.  I mean it does have that survey.  I'll give it a point. Really not that credible. It cites a survey.  It also has the President of a large non-profit. It presents the Republican party as the problem.  The cites suggests anti-republican articles.  The author holds no degree in the field.  The survey was done by the president of the group who conducted the study.  No peer-reviewed data.Not credible.  Hopefully I was verbal enough.  Have a nice day.
