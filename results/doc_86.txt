I've always seen NPR as a reliable source. I mean I'm sure it could be more reliable, but I would probably give it around an 8, maybe a 9. Just a reputable source. I've listened to them before, my parents listen to them. I just think it's a good source. I'll just google how reliable is NPR. Web pub Thursday first result Pew Research This isn't very scientific, but people trust it just as much as they do any other web or online source. Less people have heard of NPR, but the same amount of people trust it. So this guy says, on a scale of 1-10, NPR receives a 9.5 rating for credibility. I don't even know, is this reliable? What is this? Web Pub Thursday, I've never heard of this, so I don't how reliable this is. But I would still give it an 8, or maybe even a 9. Overall, what qualities/attributes make this source more reliable to you? I guess they do have, links to the information, well not really, they just tell you where they got it. Journal of Adolescent Health, where else? Well, what would make it more reliable. It's a fair question. It's just their definition of sources, maybe. A better definition of sources and more information inside the article. If it was more expansive and complete about the topic.I just wanted more information, really, pretty short article. Less It just seem's short and pretty brief as if only very little research was done. If it was more scholarly and research based, it would be more reliable.Just kind of answering the same question, here, whatever. A better definition of sources and more information inside the article. If it was more expansive and complete about the topic. It just seem's short and pretty brief as if only very little research was done. If it was more scholarly and research based, it would be more reliable. Third Way for Universities Okay, I mean, I don't know what the Huff Post is, never heard of it. I helped create this college I mean, it's really just referencing herself and what's she's done, bragging for compliments. I think it might be a 5 or 6, just based off of that. It's not third party, it's just her, talking about what she's done. That's always a little sketch. What's the Huff Post? Sort of looks pretty biased. Korie Robertson Drops Bombshell On Her 'Duck Dynasty' Husband! Is only as credible as its writers. Each article is only as credible as its author. So when reading HuffPost, consider who is writing it and what their credibility is. That's kind of what I was saying. Huffington Post is not a creator of original news content.  Interesting. So again, she's talking about herself. It's like a big blog or something.I think it's biased, but it might be reliable, she is a president of a college. I don't think, they focus on education and honesty, I'm sure. So I'll give it a 6. A 6 just because it sounds like almost anyone can post on Huff Post. From what I researched, the Huffpost is more like a blog where people post news stories. So, to make it more reliable I think they should have a team of fact checkers and editors to look over the material before it's posted. The fact that she's president of a college gives her some credibility.Someone to look at the material before it's posted. What made the less reliable is that the author of the article was talking about herself and her accomplishments. This leaves room for aggrandizement. The article isn't really attached to any other source than herself. We just have to look at her credentials and trust that she's truthful.It's not attached to any other source but herself.So the fact that she's president of a college gives her some credibility. All right, the Blaze. Hmm. Global warming fail. Let's just read this; it's short.Well, this is a useless  of course it is. This looks like nonsense. I'll give it a 4. Who are you, Justin Haskins. I feel like this is just not written well, either. Maybe I'll give it a 3. Not reliable. All right, we're looking this up. What's this the blaze. TheBlaze on a list of websites professor says students should avoid. Because of false or misleading headlines. So this, I agree with that, the headline was misleading. Just kind of.Far right, almost to extreme. All right, so again, I'm giving it a 3 if only because I didn't find it was written well, that's always kind of a, I just think, a more reputable source is going to be written well, it's going to have people going through it, editors and fact-checkers and it's not going to be  That's not well written. So. When I looked it up, it was listed as being far right, as just not factually accurate. It's made a list that students should avoid, it just doesn't have any good light on it really.More reliable:It was posted on a larger site full of new stories.Upon researching The Blaze. I found that it's been on a list of sites for students to avoid due to misleading titles. Another site labels The Blaze as being not been factually accurate.It's not reliable here. Two more, three more. All right, the Washington Post.To me this looks like, I trust the things like. I always hesitate with news site because they are typically politically biased.It's a little biased, but I don't see, I don't see any politics on this so Interesting line about Bezos owning the Washington Post. I don't know what to make of it, though.This is just promoting, I don't know, supporting, I don't see any profit off this, so I think I'd call it reliable. The Washington post is a recognized source. This article has no political or economic gains, but is simply being reported.Okay, so the reason I'm saying the Washington Post is more reliable is cause it's recognized. I feel like a lot of work is going into keeping things like the Washington Post factual and accurate, there's a video attached to it. I think it's reputable. I always hesitate with news site because they are typically politically biased.Daily Kos, I think it was on here somewhere. Okay. I'm not supposed to, I'm supposed to. Two more minutes, this is supposed to be timed.So,  There's no fact checking. That is left up to the reader. It's a far left politically speaking which introduces bias.The title sounds and looks like click bait through social media. I don't know, simply because it's on a website with special writers. It's on a known site, with people putting in time to write and publish their stories. I didn't read this. It's on a known site, with people putting in time to write and publish their stories.
