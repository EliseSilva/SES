Well. Already I'm kind of making a judgment about the search. I kind of tend to judge it on whether the website looks professional and crisp. It looks like in the corner there's a logo for some kind of radio station, National Public Radio I think. If I could see. Lots of people have already searched this it seems. I would assume that NPR means national public radio. There you go. So that looks pretty legit. Okay. That's an interesting phrase: We wrote about it and everything.¬ùAll right. 6 They have quotes from decent people. From an assistant professor of pediatrics. That sounds pretty legit. They got a link to whatever review it is there. That's pretty good. I kinda wish they said which researchers. That's on my downside there. But it feels pretty good. I wouldn't call it my primary source but I'll put it above a five. Well I already looked up NPR. If I had to go back and say what I thought about it first, without looking up what NPR is, I'd stillIt's also good that they've got the authors name there. I'd probably still give it a 6. Maybe a bit less. Maybe a low 6. Knowing what the source actually is helps a bit. Maybe I'd give it a high 6 there.I could search some more things. Birth Control search It's a pretty recent article. I didn't notice that before. That's good.You got all the links. That looks pretty legit. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 doctors. Four out of five doctors usually agree, there's always one that disagrees. But five doctors. That's pretty good. They're not just talking. Yeah. So now that I know all those links actually link to things that are legit I can see that their sources are from people who know what they're talking about, then I feel like it's even more reliable.Cause they're providing you with more information than they can give with their short amount of time.It is from a national institution. The information is cited, and cited sources are expert sources. It comes from a radio broadcast which I feel gives some leeway to embellish the truth or at least stray from the pointListens to radio. It comes from a radio news broadcast, which makes me feel like the source may be more general than specific, and in being general it provides the potential for a reader to misunderstand. Next. All right. So this one's from the Huffpost, which is, I don't know much about that but I've heard of it before. I'm really not a fan of banner ads. But I know they're important. But the ads on the side, they tend to make me judge an article. Especially when thy're not super related. Like ice. It kind of ruins the look of the site for me. It makes me worried because they can be influenced by the advertisers for example.No, but they've got the author there. I always hate it when they don't say who wrote the article. When it's anonymous. It was updated fairly recently. At least this year. The tone of the article seems to be pretty professional. That's always important. The author seems to know what she's talking about as president of a university. Yeah. That looks pretty good to me. I would actually probably rate it even higher than the last one just because I know who the author is and her credentials. I didn't know anything about the author's credentials in the last one except that maybe she was some kind of journalist. Search huffpost. I want to know about this site. But there's not like an about us section.Opens tab.Wikipedia thinks it used a generator. So I think they just gather news from various other journals. This editor.It looks like they cover a wide variety of things though. It's like a news site and Look here are those ads. I don't like those. Not because it changes the articles at all. It just changes the feel of the site. Makes it feel commercial instead of informational instead of informational or scholarly. I think the huffington post. You know its ironic because in order to find out about the huffington post I may have to go to Wikipedia, just because they didn't put any information of their own on their site. News aggregator. It gathers things together. Okay. Well it's good to know that it's politically liberal. What kind of lean that it has. Well I didn't know what the heck it is. I feel like, I think I'm gonna rate it the same. I don't think that knowing it's a news aggregator, knowing about the huffington post really increases my belief in the source, but it also doesn't hurt it. I think mostly this article seems reliable to me based upon the credentials of the author. All right. Here's another one. Oh dear. These ads I think are even worse than the last ones. Because they have sensational headlines and ridiculous pictures. Especially that: Do the amish keep these practices a secret? That seems silly to me. They're just trying to get you to click on them whatever the heck they are. You don't even know where they're from. And so that makes me feel like the source that allows those ads to be there is more focused on making money since they let whatever the heck they want get there. And, yeah, so it seems like they can be influenced more by money. None of the ads seem to relate at all to the article. It is an interesting headline though. Justin Haskins. My roommate was named Justin Hawkins. Maybe he was an undercover author. Nice picture though. I like that. It feels to be a very biased article. Very opionated. Like they seem to purport that its written as news, but its obvious from the very beginning what the spin is, that the author of the article, whoever this Justin man is doesn't believe in global warming. They're not writing it from an objective stance. Also it doesn't seem like they're stating any facts. I wanna go read that study, and what they actually studied. It doesn't say what the study studied in here. It just says it's a new study and that it suggests that. It seems that they're not quoting the actual study more as what hypothetical implications could come from the study.That's way interesting. An interesting article. I'm just not a fan of how its written. They seem to be spinning the study, and reporting only that which supports their point of view. So I don't like it as much. I wouldn't cite this in anything I use. If I was going to use it I would read the study myself and draw conclusions from it.And I feel like they just stuck this in here to have a graphic. It doesn't really relate to the article. Let's go see the Blaze's. American conservative.They've got some sponsored articles here. All right, here's the study.This isn't even a link to the real study. It's just a link to a site that doesn't like global warming. Do they like global warming?Yeah, it seems like they don't like global warming. Yeah, so I just wanna read the study.Interesting. So, I'm not really digging it. It feels like on this page, I'm reading it, and I realize that it says what the study was and what they did, but I'd like to read the study. Oh here it is. Nice. Found it. Okay, so I could figure out exactly what it was. How it works. It just took a lot of digging to get there. So it's got legit things, but the way this article reported it makes it really hard to find the actual study, and it definitely spins findings to support their own claims. I don't like it.What makes it more reliable? They do cite sources. That's good. The Blaze is an established company, at least it's not Interrupted by pop-up Ugh.The ads. There was a freakin' pop-up ad. Seriously. Those are just so tacky.Next. Okay so it's from the Washington post. That's a reliable source, at least from first glance. It's got a good reputation. It's long established. The ads don't seem obnoxious. They're not intrusive. There's just one.Wow. That's so cool. Wow. Also it's a really cool article. I like it. So based on, it's from the Washington post which seems to be a reliable source, at least from reputation, from hearsay. They have quotes from the sources, from like the highest people in the company, they're reporting on, from whathisname. Musk. Mr. Musk. We've got video of the launch. That's always important to have some video documentation. The ads aren't intrusive. It just feels reputable. I'm gonna put it up here. This seems to be the most reputable source yet. And I just barely realized. I haven't ever tried to, like cross reference any of these sites.So they've got the credentials of the author down at the bottom. That's good.So that's good. But I think it would be a good idea to try and look at these sources if, see if any other sources report the same thing.Yeah, there's lots. In fact, the Washington post article doesn't even show up on here because, I could, this is just a topic that interests me. I could spend a lot of time researching it. But, it seems like this article was, has been reported by other people. Watches video.Wow. That's cool stuff. Okay, all personal bias aside, about the subject matter. I think the source seems reliable because it matches up with other sources. So I'd even give this a nine. I don't actually know even what I have to doubt. One interesting thing is that it mentions the owner of the Washington post is also doing something like this, so that could maybe influence the reporting a little bit. But it seems like this source can be trusted to me. I feel like the looking up of other websites, like comparing it with other websites should be something I do more. Next.Okay, there's just two more. The Daily Kos, whatever the heck that is. Reading. Just by looking at, just by reading the article I'm looking at all the other articles. It seems that this is very biased. Almost as biased as the Blaze one. This time it seems to be a liberal bias, especially against the Republican health care bill. There doesn't seem to be any credentials for the author, but the author's there. This may be a little bit silly but they're not intrusive. It seems to be targeted at, older people? Okay well. They do seem to have fairly reliable sources that they cite. It seems to appeal mostly to emotion. It does report facts though. It's a good fact-filled article. I'll probably give it a high six. I dunno I can't decide. It's somewhere between a six and seven. Because the bias makes me feel like I could be getting fooled, but they do report with facts and figures. I just don't like how unabashedly biased it is. It makes me feel like the reporting isn't, I'm not getting all the information that I could be getting. But I'll have to wait and see as I, do some other research here .Next Well it is a blog. Okay, that's good to know.So here are all the author's things. Everything against Republicans. I can't find the article that I want to. It's really hard to find what I'm looking for on this site. Well, I just can't get over the bias. And also that it's a blog. There's not a lot of peer review or reliability, or accountability that goes into blog writing. I don't find blogs to be a particularly reliable source. But it's undeniable that they use facts and figures and those things can be verified.
