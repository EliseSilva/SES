Okay so just looking at it, it looks like a normal web article, maybe not from an official newspaper but no, no, from health news from NPR so it looks like it's pretty official from this top.  They use fancy words to make it seem like it's legit, like obstetrician. So they are mentioning facts, not citing sources. Well, no, they do down here. But at the top they talk about the laws and they talk about them like they know what they are saying. Searches over the counter birth control pills would be safe for teens.I'm going to look up the article itself. It's aorg so you know that old rule of thumb teachers tell you if it's aorg or agov it's usually a safe site? They are using scientific terms to make it seem like they know what they are talking about. Again they use a lot of names and a lot of quotes so it seems like this is a pretty legit website. After I'm done with this I'm going to look up other NPR articles just to make sure. Scrolls through offerings of other NPR articles Trump Says 'I Think it Was Russia' and 'Other's Also' in Election Meddling. This one is using presidential quotes so it's really hard to fake. I feel like this is a legit site. The article itself is obviously biased but it looks like they did their homework. So I'd say this is a pretty legit article scientific terms, quotes, well written, and the other articles on the site seem just as legitimate. I guess it's well written too. They used a lot of rhetorical skills that we're learning in our class right now, and it's easy to read, so that's probably a big part of it too. obvious bias, formatting makes it seem more like a blog than a news source. Don't put too much weight on that last response. And even though NPR is a news site, something about the set up makes it seem less legitimate than if it were in a newspaper. Maybe that's just me preferring print, but Oh, I did that wrong.  I feel like it was pretty legitimate even when I was coming through it the first time. It helped when I got the other but it's okay. A Third Way for Universities. So this quote right here In higher education people like to pick sides and stay there, often in the face of stubborn facts um, that's true from what I've seen in life and from what I've learned in psychology; people tend to stick to their point of view. So I guess that one thing in the beginning makes it feel more credible. But that's also not fact, it's just an everyday life thing.  Okay, just scanning this it looks like they mention things but they don't have quotes so much, it's more like the author's opinion. No quotes, no scientific. oh, it looks like there might be stuff down here, just a sec. I mean that's pretty good ethos right there, When I helped create the Savannah College of Art and Design, so that wins her points. Okay, here's the first quotation outside and we're what, 8 paragraphs in. So this seems more an opin oh, Huff Post, yeah this seems more like an opinion article but I mean she does sound like someone that knows what she is talking about. She founded a college, so it's not as good as the other one, I don't know, because it's just an opinion, but it's an opinion from an expert, so I'll go with a 7. Maybe I'm not being skeptical enough. So the article itself is pretty good but let's look at the other things. War Cry: Trump Rages About Civilization. That's um an outrageous claim. Obviously it's really biased, but again biased doesn't mean untrue. Let's see if there's a way to get a random article. Let's go under education, it's what we're doing.  Founder of the PEAR Institute. looks like they have pretty educated people going on to write articles. It looks like it's by someone who knows, she brings up some interesting points. I can't see any obvious flaws or typos or anything, so I'm going to stick with my 7.  Maybe she deserves an 8. Or maybe the last one just deserves a higher score. Yeah, looking back, I probably would have trusted wholeheartedly. The writer seems to have experience in the area, some outside references, no obvious flaws or fallacies, good formatting.  Oh the formatting was pretty good, I noticed that. I don't know what it is, it feels a little more official, than the last one, which is probably why I didn't give it a 10. Opinion article. Huffington Post related. I've kind of been warned away from Huffington Post by past teachers. I mean it's a pretty good article. Goes back and forth between 7 and 8. It might be an 8. Hmmm, I'm going to give it an 8. Maybe I'm too generous. The Blaze Ok, so it's an unpopular point of view. It's the Blaze, I think that's the conservative paper related with Glenn Beck, so it's familiar. K, they cite a study. K, maybe I'm a little biased because all the overwhelming support for climate change, global warming, is bad. I don't know, I just feel like it may accidentally put a strain on species in some parts of the world. Then again maybe I'm coming in biased. I mean this is obviously biased as well, but it's written more like a news article than an opinion article which puts it above the other. It has a good source: University of Southern Denmark, it's a study, there's some good logos right there. I mean they're agreeing; you always hear oh the arctic ice is melting. They are not denying. I'm going to say looking at it right now, it's a 6 or a 7, not it's a. I guess the stuff on the side is throwing me off because it's supposed to be a news source and then you have sensationalist stuff like New Limitless Pill Will Go Public in Less than 24 Hours and How to Fix Cracked Feet and stuff like that is actually throwing me off.  I can just look this up after. I'm going to look up this article and then look up the study. Okay I like the formatting a lot better on this screenshot.  Okay, let's look up.  Okay, so, it looks like it's on other websites too. Oh yeah, no this study has been cited by multiple websites, multiple different news sites. Let's see if we can find it. Or maybe they'll have a link somewhere. Oh, that's a good picture. Ok, so this source seems legit. So before I would say a 6 or a 7, now I would say an 8 or a 9. It's basically just talking about this one study, and the study is legit It's legitimate because it's on multiple websites, and I guess when I hear University of Southern Denmark I think oh wow, it must be legitimate. I don't see any obvious logical fallacies. the study cited is on multiple websites, name dropping a university gives it credibility, the study itself seems legitimate, no noticeable fallacies. Graph looks official. links on the side of the page, preconceived notions of The Blaze. Yeah, they've got the graph too. The graph makes it look nice. Probably could've had the other picture though. Washington Post Article Wow, that's some charged language right there: some fiery theatrics of boosters screaming back from space only to explodeWashington Post, that's a source I've heard before. These advertisements seem high class. OK this seems pretty legitimate, from the website title, to the evidence provided, to the message given, to the advertisements on the side. Still, I don't trust anything 100%. Also, it's arguing that the rocket is good, but other than that it doesn't seem to have much bias that I can pick up. preconceived notions of website, adds and links seem intelligent, uses facts and quotes, drops facts like he knows itI think he uses a quote, just a sec he's dropping a lot of namesyeah here's the quote. Also, I should probably check the gender before I keep saying he. Christian, it's probably a he. Okay let's look this up. I guess it's just how web articles are laid out but I just like the print better. It feels more official.  I mean it seems pretty reliable but it's not offering much information other than what the rocket does. So I'd say it's reliable but not very useful. nothing in particular. Let's say 10 because useful doesn't mean it's not reliable. Daily KosOkay, so right off the bat, I've never seen this site before, that's probably affecting it. All the links on the side, seems a little sensationalist. And very informal, where it's like Oh, and it's a job crisis too. Okay, so let's read the actual article. Oooh, vulnerable people, look at that: emotion.  , they should probably name the study. Yeah, it seems like whoever wrote it has a really strong agenda. I wouldn't rate this very high because it feels like it's all an agenda, like they have the facts about the pay and the survey, but justI would probably not cite this article but I would go to the sources they provide. I would say this is a 5.  I wouldn't cite this source. unknown website, obviously biased, emotionally charged. good facts, cites a survey   Whoever did this report obviously spent a lot of time to make it look niceI'd rather have, I don't know,  a more official looking one. Goes back to slider. Yeah, the site itself has some good things.  I feel kind of dumb but. Again, this website, I don't think it's very reliable in itself. I find the survey more reliable. Let's look at that other link really quick Scrolls through. So why do they link to this and not the Bureau of Labor Statistics? (sees link for this in WP article) Yeah, the source itself isn't good, I would probably just use the links to see what it does. And it's a survey, not a study. Yeah, I wouldn't find this very reliable.
